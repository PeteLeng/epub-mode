<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">hou</span> wilt love her dearly,” repeated Hester
Prynne, as she and the minister sat watching
little Pearl. “Dost thou not think her
beautiful? And see with what natural
skill she has made those simple flowers
adorn her! Had she gathered pearls, and
diamonds, and rubies, in the wood, they could not have become
her better. She is a splendid child! But I know whose brow
she has!”</p>
<p>“Dost thou know, Hester,” said Arthur Dimmesdale, with
an unquiet smile, “that this dear child, tripping about always
at thy side, hath caused me many an alarm? Methought—O
Hester, what a thought is that, and how terrible to dread it!—that
my own features were partly repeated in her face, and so
strikingly that the world might see them! But she is mostly
thine!”</p>
<p>“No, no! Not mostly!” answered the mother, with a tender
smile. “A little longer, and thou needest not to be afraid
to trace whose child she is. But how strangely beautiful she<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[254]" id="pgepubid00271"><a id="Page_254" title="[254]"></a></span>
looks, with those wild-flowers in her hair! It is as if one of
the fairies, whom we left in our dear old England, had decked
her out to meet us.”</p>
<p>It was with a feeling which neither of them had ever before
experienced, that they sat and watched Pearl’s slow advance.
In her was visible the tie that united them. She had been
offered to the world, these seven years past, as the living hieroglyphic,
in which was revealed the secret they so darkly sought
to hide,—all written in this symbol,—all plainly manifest,—had
there been a prophet or magician skilled to read the character
of flame! And Pearl was the oneness of their being. Be
the foregone evil what it might, how could they doubt that
their earthly lives and future destinies were conjoined, when
they beheld at once the material union, and the spiritual idea,
in whom they met, and were to dwell immortally together?
Thoughts like these—and perhaps other thoughts, which they
did not acknowledge or define—threw an awe about the child,
as she came onward.</p>
<p>“Let her see nothing strange—no passion nor eagerness—in
thy way of accosting her,” whispered Hester. “Our Pearl
is a fitful and fantastic little elf, sometimes. Especially, she is
seldom tolerant of emotion, when she does not fully comprehend
the why and wherefore. But the child hath strong affections!
She loves me, and will love thee!”</p>
<p>“Thou canst not think,” said the minister, glancing aside
at Hester Prynne, “how my heart dreads this interview, and
yearns for it! But, in truth, as I already told thee, children
are not readily won to be familiar with me. They will not
climb my knee, nor prattle in my ear, nor answer to my smile;
but stand apart, and eye me strangely. Even little babes, when<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[255]" id="pgepubid00272"><a id="Page_255" title="[255]"></a></span>
I take them in my arms, weep bitterly. Yet Pearl, twice in
her little lifetime, hath been kind to me! The first time,—thou
knowest it well! The last was when thou ledst her with
thee to the house of yonder stern old Governor.”</p>
<p>“And thou didst plead so bravely in her behalf and mine!”
answered the mother. “I remember it; and so shall little
Pearl. Fear nothing! She may be strange and shy at first,
but will soon learn to love thee!”</p>
<p>By this time Pearl had reached the margin of the brook, and
stood on the farther side, gazing silently at Hester and the
clergyman, who still sat together on the mossy tree-trunk, waiting
to receive her. Just where she had paused, the brook
chanced to form a pool, so smooth and quiet that it reflected
a perfect image of her little figure, with all the brilliant picturesqueness
of her beauty, in its adornment of flowers and wreathed
foliage, but more refined and spiritualized than the reality. This
image, so nearly identical with the living Pearl, seemed to communicate
somewhat of its own shadowy and intangible quality
to the child herself. It was strange, the way in which Pearl
stood, looking so steadfastly at them through the dim medium
of the forest-gloom; herself, meanwhile, all glorified with a ray
of sunshine, that was attracted thitherward as by a certain sympathy.
In the brook beneath stood another child,—another
and the same,—with likewise its ray of golden light. Hester
felt herself, in some indistinct and tantalizing manner, estranged
from Pearl; as if the child, in her lonely ramble through the
forest, had strayed out of the sphere in which she and her
mother dwelt together, and was now vainly seeking to return
to it.</p>
<p>There was both truth and error in the impression; the child<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[256]" id="pgepubid00273"><a id="Page_256" title="[256]"></a></span>
and mother were estranged, but through Hester’s fault, not
Pearl’s. Since the latter rambled from her side, another inmate
had been admitted within the circle of the mother’s feelings,
and so modified the aspect of them all, that Pearl, the returning
wanderer, could not find her wonted place, and hardly knew
where she was.</p>
<p>“I have a strange fancy,” observed the sensitive minister,
“that this brook is the boundary between two worlds, and that
thou canst never meet thy Pearl again. Or is she an elfish
spirit, who, as the legends of our childhood taught us, is forbidden
to cross a running stream? Pray hasten her; for this
delay has already imparted a tremor to my nerves.”</p>
<p>“Come, dearest child!” said Hester, encouragingly, and stretching
out both her arms. “How slow thou art! When hast
thou been so sluggish before now? Here is a friend of mine,
who must be thy friend also. Thou wilt have twice as much
love, henceforward, as thy mother alone could give thee! Leap
across the brook, and come to us. Thou canst leap like a
young deer!”</p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[257]" id="pgepubid00274"><a id="Page_257" title="[257]"></a></span><a href="9125950922386535487_illu_257.jpg.id-8808014379940881844.wrap-0.html.xhtml" id="id-8808014379940881844" title="linked image"><img alt="The Child at the Brook-Side" src="9125950922386535487_illu_257_th.jpg" title="The Child at the Brook-Side" id="img_images_illu_257_th.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Pearl, without responding in any manner to these honey-sweet
expressions, remained on the other side of the brook. Now she
fixed her bright, wild eyes on her mother, now on the minister,
and now included them both in the same glance; as if to detect
and explain to herself the relation which they bore to one
another. For some unaccountable reason, as Arthur Dimmesdale<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[258]" id="pgepubid00275"><a id="Page_258" title="[258]"></a></span>
felt the child’s eyes upon himself, his hand—with that
gesture so habitual as to have become involuntary—stole over
his heart. At length, assuming a singular air of authority,
Pearl stretched out her hand, with the small forefinger extended,
and pointing evidently towards her mother’s breast. And<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[259]"><a id="Page_259" title="[259]"></a></span>
beneath, in the mirror of the brook, there was the flower-girdled
and sunny image of little Pearl, pointing her small forefinger
too.</p>
<p>“Thou strange child, why dost thou not come to me?” exclaimed
Hester.</p>
<p>Pearl still pointed with her forefinger; and a frown gathered
on her brow; the more impressive from the childish, the almost
baby-like aspect of the features that conveyed it. As her mother
still kept beckoning to her, and arraying her face in a holiday
suit of unaccustomed smiles, the child stamped her foot with a
yet more imperious look and gesture. In the brook, again, was
the fantastic beauty of the image, with its reflected frown, its
pointed finger, and imperious gesture, giving emphasis to the
aspect of little Pearl.</p>
<p>“Hasten, Pearl; or I shall be angry with thee!” cried
Hester Prynne, who, however inured to such behavior on
the elf-child’s part at other seasons, was naturally anxious
for a more seemly deportment now. “Leap across the
brook, naughty child, and run hither! Else I must come to
thee!”</p>
<p>But Pearl, not a whit startled at her mother’s threats, any
more than mollified by her entreaties, now suddenly burst into
a fit of passion, gesticulating violently, and throwing her small
figure into the most extravagant contortions. She accompanied
this wild outbreak with piercing shrieks, which the woods reverberated
on all sides; so that, alone as she was in her childish
and unreasonable wrath, it seemed as if a hidden multitude were
lending her their sympathy and encouragement. Seen in the
brook, once more, was the shadowy wrath of Pearl’s image,
crowned and girdled with flowers, but stamping its foot, wildly<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[260]" id="pgepubid00276"><a id="Page_260" title="[260]"></a></span>
gesticulating, and, in the midst of all, still pointing its small
forefinger at Hester’s bosom!</p>
<p>“I see what ails the child,” whispered Hester to the clergyman,
and turning pale in spite of a strong effort to conceal her
trouble and annoyance. “Children will not abide any, the
slightest, change in the accustomed aspect of things that are
daily before their eyes. Pearl misses something which she has
always seen me wear!”</p>
<p>“I pray you,” answered the minister, “if thou hast any
means of pacifying the child, do it forthwith! Save it were the
cankered wrath of an old witch, like Mistress Hibbins,” added
he, attempting to smile, “I know nothing that I would not
sooner encounter than this passion in a child. In Pearl’s young
beauty, as in the wrinkled witch, it has a preternatural effect.
Pacify her, if thou lovest me!”</p>
<p>Hester turned again towards Pearl, with a crimson blush upon
her cheek, a conscious glance aside at the clergyman, and then a
heavy sigh; while, even before she had time to speak, the blush
yielded to a deadly pallor.</p>
<p>“Pearl,” said she, sadly, “look down at thy feet! There!—before
thee!—on the hither side of the brook!”</p>
<p>The child turned her eyes to the point indicated; and there
lay the scarlet letter, so close upon the margin of the stream,
that the gold embroidery was reflected in it.</p>
<p>“Bring it hither!” said Hester.</p>
<p>“Come thou and take it up!” answered Pearl.</p>
<p>“Was ever such a child!” observed Hester, aside to the
minister. “O, I have much to tell thee about her! But, in
very truth, she is right as regards this hateful token. I must
bear its torture yet a little longer,—only a few days longer,—until<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[261]" id="pgepubid00277"><a id="Page_261" title="[261]"></a></span>
we shall have left this region, and look back hither as
to a land which we have dreamed of. The forest cannot hide
it! The mid-ocean shall take it from my hand, and swallow it
up forever!”</p>
<p>With these words, she advanced to the margin of the brook,
took up the scarlet letter, and fastened it again into her bosom.
Hopefully, but a moment ago, as Hester had spoken of drowning
it in the deep sea, there was a sense of inevitable doom
upon her, as she thus received back this deadly symbol from
the hand of fate. She had flung it into infinite space!—she
had drawn an hour’s free breath!—and here again was the
scarlet misery, glittering on the old spot! So it ever is, whether
thus typified or no, that an evil deed invests itself with the
character of doom. Hester next gathered up the heavy tresses
of her hair, and confined them beneath her cap. As if there
were a withering spell in the sad letter, her beauty, the warmth
and richness of her womanhood, departed, like fading sunshine;
and a gray shadow seemed to fall across her.</p>
<p>When the dreary change was wrought, she extended her hand
to Pearl.</p>
<p>“Dost thou know thy mother now, child?” asked she, reproachfully,
but with a subdued tone. “Wilt thou come across
the brook, and own thy mother, now that she has her shame
upon her,—now that she is sad?”</p>
<p>“Yes; now I will!” answered the child, bounding across
the brook, and clasping Hester in her arms. “Now thou art
my mother indeed! And I am thy little Pearl!”</p>
<p>In a mood of tenderness that was not usual with her, she
drew down her mother’s head, and kissed her brow and both
her cheeks. But then—by a kind of necessity that always impelled<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[262]" id="pgepubid00278"><a id="Page_262" title="[262]"></a></span>
this child to alloy whatever comfort she might chance to
give with a throb of anguish—Pearl put up her mouth, and
kissed the scarlet letter too!</p>
<p>“That was not kind!” said Hester. “When thou hast shown
me a little love, thou mockest me!”</p>
<p>“Why doth the minister sit yonder?” asked Pearl.</p>
<p>“He waits to welcome thee,” replied her mother. “Come
thou, and entreat his blessing! He loves thee, my little Pearl,
and loves thy mother too. Wilt thou not love him? Come!
he longs to greet thee!”</p>
<p>“Doth he love us?” said Pearl, looking up, with acute
intelligence, into her mother’s face. “Will he go back with
us, hand in hand, we three together, into the town?”</p>
<p>“Not now, dear child,” answered Hester. “But in days to
come he will walk hand in hand with us. We will have a
home and fireside of our own; and thou shalt sit upon his
knee; and he will teach thee many things, and love thee dearly.
Thou wilt love him; wilt thou not?”</p>
<p>“And will he always keep his hand over his heart?” inquired
Pearl.</p>
<p>“Foolish child, what a question is that!” exclaimed her
mother. “Come and ask his blessing!”</p>
<p>But, whether influenced by the jealousy that seems instinctive
with every petted child towards a dangerous rival, or from whatever
caprice of her freakish nature, Pearl would show no favor
to the clergyman. It was only by an exertion of force that
her mother brought her up to him, hanging back, and manifesting
her reluctance by odd grimaces; of which, ever since her
babyhood, she had possessed a singular variety, and could transform
her mobile physiognomy into a series of different aspects,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[263]" id="pgepubid00279"><a id="Page_263" title="[263]"></a></span>
with a new mischief in them, each and all. The minister—painfully
embarrassed, but hoping that a kiss might prove a
talisman to admit him into the child’s kindlier regards—bent
forward, and impressed one on her brow. Hereupon, Pearl
broke away from her mother, and, running to the brook, stooped
over it, and bathed her forehead, until the unwelcome kiss was
quite washed off, and diffused through a long lapse of the gliding
water. She then remained apart, silently watching Hester
and the clergyman; while they talked together, and made such
arrangements as were suggested by their new position, and the
purposes soon to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>And now this fateful interview had come to a close. The
dell was to be left a solitude among its dark, old trees, which,
with their multitudinous tongues, would whisper long of what
had passed there, and no mortal be the wiser. And the melancholy
brook would add this other tale to the mystery with
which its little heart was already overburdened, and whereof it
still kept up a murmuring babble, with not a whit more cheerfulness
of tone than for ages heretofore.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">s</span> the minister departed, in advance of Hester
Prynne and little Pearl, he threw a backward
glance; half expecting that he should
discover only some faintly traced features or
outline of the mother and the child, slowly
fading into the twilight of the woods. So
great a vicissitude in his life could not at once be received as
real. But there was Hester, clad in her gray robe, still standing
beside the tree-trunk, which some blast had overthrown a long
antiquity ago, and which time had ever since been covering
with moss, so that these two fated ones, with earth’s heaviest
burden on them, might there sit down together, and find a single
hour’s rest and solace. And there was Pearl, too, lightly dancing
from the margin of the brook,—now that the intrusive third
person was gone,—and taking her old place by her mother’s
side. So the minister had not fallen asleep and dreamed!</p>
<p>In order to free his mind from this indistinctness and duplicity
of impression, which vexed it with a strange disquietude, he
recalled and more thoroughly defined the plans which Hester<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[265]" id="pgepubid00283"><a id="Page_265" title="[265]"></a></span>
and himself had sketched for their departure. It had been determined
between them, that the Old World, with its crowds and
cities, offered them a more eligible shelter and concealment than
the wilds of New England, or all America, with its alternatives
of an Indian wigwam, or the few settlements of Europeans,
scattered thinly along the seaboard. Not to speak of the clergyman’s
health, so inadequate to sustain the hardships of a forest
life, his native gifts, his culture, and his entire development,
would secure him a home only in the midst of civilization and
refinement; the higher the state, the more delicately adapted
to it the man. In furtherance of this choice, it so happened
that a ship lay in the harbor; one of those questionable cruisers,
frequent at that day, which, without being absolutely outlaws
of the deep, yet roamed over its surface with a remarkable irresponsibility
of character. This vessel had recently arrived from
the Spanish Main, and, within three days’ time, would sail for
Bristol. Hester Prynne—whose vocation, as a self-enlisted
Sister of Charity, had brought her acquainted with the captain
and crew—could take upon herself to secure the passage of
two individuals and a child, with all the secrecy which circumstances
rendered more than desirable.</p>
<p>The minister had inquired of Hester, with no little interest,
the precise time at which the vessel might be expected to
depart. It would probably be on the fourth day from the present.
“That is most fortunate!” he had then said to himself.
Now, why the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale considered it so very
fortunate, we hesitate to reveal. Nevertheless,—to hold nothing
back from the reader,—it was because, on the third day
from the present, he was to preach the Election Sermon; and,
as such an occasion formed an honorable epoch in the life of<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[266]" id="pgepubid00284"><a id="Page_266" title="[266]"></a></span>
a New England clergyman, he could not have chanced upon a
more suitable mode and time of terminating his professional
career. “At least, they shall say of me,” thought this exemplary
man, “that I leave no public duty unperformed, nor ill
performed!” Sad, indeed, that an introspection so profound
and acute as this poor minister’s should be so miserably deceived!
We have had, and may still have, worse things to tell of him;
but none, we apprehend, so pitiably weak; no evidence, at once
so slight and irrefragable, of a subtle disease, that had long
since begun to eat into the real substance of his character. No
man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to himself,
and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered
as to which may be the true.</p>
<p>The excitement of Mr. Dimmesdale’s feelings, as he returned
from his interview with Hester, lent him unaccustomed physical
energy, and hurried him townward at a rapid pace. The pathway
among the woods seemed wilder, more uncouth with its
rude natural obstacles, and less trodden by the foot of man,
than he remembered it on his outward journey. But he leaped
across the plashy places, thrust himself through the clinging
underbrush, climbed the ascent, plunged into the hollow, and
overcame, in short, all the difficulties of the track, with an
unweariable activity that astonished him. He could not but
recall how feebly, and with what frequent pauses for breath, he
had toiled over the same ground, only two days before. As he
drew near the town, he took an impression of change from the
series of familiar objects that presented themselves. It seemed
not yesterday, not one, nor two, but many days, or even years
ago, since he had quitted them. There, indeed, was each former
trace of the street, as he remembered it, and all the peculiarities<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[267]" id="pgepubid00285"><a id="Page_267" title="[267]"></a></span>
of the houses, with the due multitude of gable-peaks, and a
weathercock at every point where his memory suggested one.
Not the less, however, came this importunately obtrusive sense
of change. The same was true as regarded the acquaintances
whom he met, and all the well-known shapes of human life,
about the little town. They looked neither older nor younger
now; the beards of the aged were no whiter, nor could the
creeping babe of yesterday walk on his feet to-day; it was
impossible to describe in what respect they differed from the
individuals on whom he had so recently bestowed a parting
glance; and yet the minister’s deepest sense seemed to inform
him of their mutability. A similar impression struck him most
remarkably, as he passed under the walls of his own church.
The edifice had so very strange, and yet so familiar, an aspect,
that Mr. Dimmesdale’s mind vibrated between two ideas; either
that he had seen it only in a dream hitherto, or that he was
merely dreaming about it now.</p>
<p>This phenomenon, in the various shapes which it assumed,
indicated no external change, but so sudden and important a
change in the spectator of the familiar scene, that the intervening
space of a single day had operated on his consciousness like
the lapse of years. The minister’s own will, and Hester’s will,
and the fate that grew between them, had wrought this transformation.
It was the same town as heretofore; but the same
minister returned not from the forest. He might have said to
the friends who greeted him,—“I am not the man for whom
you take me! I left him yonder in the forest, withdrawn into
a secret dell, by a mossy tree-trunk, and near a melancholy
brook! Go, seek your minister, and see if his emaciated figure,
his thin cheek, his white, heavy, pain-wrinkled brow, be not<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[268]" id="pgepubid00286"><a id="Page_268" title="[268]"></a></span>
flung down there, like a cast-off garment!” His friends, no
doubt, would still have insisted with him,—“Thou art thyself
the man!”—but the error would have been their own, not his.</p>
<p>Before Mr. Dimmesdale reached home, his inner man gave
him other evidences of a revolution in the sphere of thought
and feeling. In truth, nothing short of a total change of
dynasty and moral code, in that interior kingdom, was adequate
to account for the impulses now communicated to the unfortunate
and startled minister. At every step he was incited to do
some strange, wild, wicked thing or other, with a sense that it
would be at once involuntary and intentional; in spite of himself,
yet growing out of a profounder self than that which
opposed the impulse. For instance, he met one of his own
deacons. The good old man addressed him with the paternal
affection and patriarchal privilege, which his venerable age, his
upright and holy character, and his station in the Church,
entitled him to use; and, conjoined with this, the deep, almost
worshipping respect, which the minister’s professional and private
claims alike demanded. Never was there a more beautiful
example of how the majesty of age and wisdom may comport
with the obeisance and respect enjoined upon it, as from a
lower social rank, and inferior order of endowment, towards
a higher. Now, during a conversation of some two or three
moments between the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale and this excellent
and hoary-bearded deacon, it was only by the most careful
self-control that the former could refrain from uttering certain
blasphemous suggestions that rose into his mind, respecting the
communion supper. He absolutely trembled and turned pale as
ashes, lest his tongue should wag itself, in utterance of these
horrible matters, and plead his own consent for so doing, without<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[269]" id="pgepubid00287"><a id="Page_269" title="[269]"></a></span>
his having fairly given it. And, even with this terror in
his heart, he could hardly avoid laughing, to imagine how the
sanctified old patriarchal deacon would have been petrified by
his minister’s impiety!</p>
<p>Again, another incident of the same nature. Hurrying along
the street, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale encountered the eldest
female member of his church; a most pious and exemplary old
dame; poor, widowed, lonely, and with a heart as full of
reminiscences about her dead husband and children, and her
dead friends of long ago, as a burial-ground is full of storied
gravestones. Yet all this, which would else have been such
heavy sorrow, was made almost a solemn joy to her devout old
soul, by religious consolations and the truths of Scripture,
wherewith she had fed herself continually for more than thirty
years. And, since Mr. Dimmesdale had taken her in charge,
the good grandam’s chief earthly comfort—which, unless it had
been likewise a heavenly comfort, could have been none at all—was
to meet her pastor, whether casually, or of set purpose,
and be refreshed with a word of warm, fragrant, heaven-breathing
Gospel truth, from his beloved lips, into her dulled, but
rapturously attentive ear. But, on this occasion, up to the
moment of putting his lips to the old woman’s ear, Mr. Dimmesdale,
as the great enemy of souls would have it, could recall no
text of Scripture, nor aught else, except a brief, pithy, and, as
it then appeared to him, unanswerable argument against the
immortality of the human soul. The instilment thereof into her
mind would probably have caused this aged sister to drop down
dead, at once, as by the effect of an intensely poisonous infusion.
What he really did whisper, the minister could never afterwards
recollect. There was, perhaps, a fortunate disorder in his utterance,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[270]" id="pgepubid00288"><a id="Page_270" title="[270]"></a></span>
which failed to impart any distinct idea to the good
widow’s comprehension, or which Providence interpreted after a
method of its own. Assuredly, as the minister looked back, he
beheld an expression of divine gratitude and ecstasy that seemed
like the shine of the celestial city on her face, so wrinkled and
ashy pale.</p>
<p>Again, a third instance. After parting from the old church-member,
he met the youngest sister of them all. It was a
maiden newly won—and won by the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale’s
own sermon, on the Sabbath after his vigil—to barter
the transitory pleasures of the world for the heavenly hope, that
was to assume brighter substance as life grew dark around her,
and which would gild the utter gloom with final glory. She
was fair and pure as a lily that had bloomed in Paradise. The
minister knew well that he was himself enshrined within the
stainless sanctity of her heart, which hung its snowy curtains
about his image, imparting to religion the warmth of love, and
to love a religious purity. Satan, that afternoon, had surely led
the poor young girl away from her mother’s side, and thrown
her into the pathway of this sorely tempted, or—shall we not
rather say?—this lost and desperate man. As she drew nigh,
the arch-fiend whispered him to condense into small compass
and drop into her tender bosom a germ of evil that would be
sure to blossom darkly soon, and bear black fruit betimes. Such
was his sense of power over this virgin soul, trusting him as
she did, that the minister felt potent to blight all the field of
innocence with but one wicked look, and develop all its opposite
with but a word. So—with a mightier struggle than he had
yet sustained—he held his Geneva cloak before his face, and
hurried onward, making no sign of recognition, and leaving the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[271]" id="pgepubid00289"><a id="Page_271" title="[271]"></a></span>
young sister to digest his rudeness as she might. She ransacked
her conscience,—which was full of harmless little matters, like
her pocket or her work-bag,—and took herself to task, poor
thing! for a thousand imaginary faults; and went about her
household duties with swollen eyelids the next morning.</p>
<p>Before the minister had time to celebrate his victory over this
last temptation, he was conscious of another impulse, more ludicrous,
and almost as horrible. It was,—we blush to tell it,—it
was to stop short in the road, and teach some very wicked
words to a knot of little Puritan children who were playing
there, and had but just begun to talk. Denying himself this
freak, as unworthy of his cloth, he met a drunken seaman, one
of the ship’s crew from the Spanish Main. And, here, since
he had so valiantly forborne all other wickedness, poor Mr.
Dimmesdale longed, at least, to shake hands with the tarry
blackguard, and recreate himself with a few improper jests, such
as dissolute sailors so abound with, and a volley of good, round,
solid, satisfactory, and heaven-defying oaths! It was not so
much a better principle as partly his natural good taste, and
still more his buckramed habit of clerical decorum, that carried
him safely through the latter crisis.</p>
<p>“What is it that haunts and tempts me thus?” cried the
minister to himself, at length, pausing in the street, and striking
his hand against his forehead. “Am I mad? or am I given
over utterly to the fiend? Did I make a contract with him
in the forest, and sign it with my blood? And does he now
summon me to its fulfilment, by suggesting the performance
of every wickedness which his most foul imagination can conceive?”</p>
<p>At the moment when the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale thus<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[272]" id="pgepubid00290"><a id="Page_272" title="[272]"></a></span>
communed with himself, and struck his forehead with his hand,
old Mistress Hibbins, the reputed witch-lady, is said to have
been passing by. She made a very grand appearance; having
on a high head-dress, a rich gown of velvet, and a ruff done up
with the famous yellow starch, of which Ann Turner, her especial
friend, had taught her the secret, before this last good lady
had been hanged for Sir Thomas Overbury’s murder. Whether
the witch had read the minister’s thoughts, or no, she came to
a full stop, looked shrewdly into his face, smiled craftily, and—though
little given to converse with clergymen—began a conversation.</p>
<p>“So, reverend Sir, you have made a visit into the forest,”
observed the witch-lady, nodding her high head-dress at him.
“The next time, I pray you to allow me only a fair warning,
and I shall be proud to bear you company. Without taking
overmuch upon myself, my good word will go far towards gaining
any strange gentleman a fair reception from yonder potentate
you wot of!”</p>
<p>“I profess, madam,” answered the clergyman, with a grave
obeisance, such as the lady’s rank demanded, and his own good-breeding
made imperative,—“I profess, on my conscience and
character, that I am utterly bewildered as touching the purport
of your words! I went not into the forest to seek a potentate;
neither do I, at any future time, design a visit thither, with a
view to gaining the favor of such a personage. My one sufficient
object was to greet that pious friend of mine, the Apostle
Eliot, and rejoice with him over the many precious souls he
hath won from heathendom!”</p>
<p>“Ha, ha, ha!” cackled the old witch-lady, still nodding her
high head-dress at the minister. “Well, well, we must needs<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[273]" id="pgepubid00291"><a id="Page_273" title="[273]"></a></span>
talk thus in the daytime! You carry it off like an old hand!
But at midnight, and in the forest, we shall have other talk
together!”</p>
<p>She passed on with her aged stateliness, but often turning
back her head and smiling at him, like one willing to recognize
a secret intimacy of connection.</p>
<p>“Have I then sold myself,” thought the minister, “to the
fiend whom, if men say true, this yellow-starched and velveted
old hag has chosen for her prince and master!”</p>
<p>The wretched minister! He had made a bargain very like
it! Tempted by a dream of happiness, he had yielded himself,
with deliberate choice, as he had never done before, to what he
knew was deadly sin. And the infectious poison of that sin
had been thus rapidly diffused throughout his moral system. It
had stupefied all blessed impulses, and awakened into vivid life
the whole brotherhood of bad ones. Scorn, bitterness, unprovoked
malignity, gratuitous desire of ill, ridicule of whatever
was good and holy, all awoke, to tempt, even while they frightened
him. And his encounter with old Mistress Hibbins, if it
were a real incident, did but show his sympathy and fellowship
with wicked mortals, and the world of perverted spirits.</p>
<p>He had, by this time, reached his dwelling, on the edge of
the burial-ground, and, hastening up the stairs, took refuge in
his study. The minister was glad to have reached this shelter,
without first betraying himself to the world by any of those
strange and wicked eccentricities to which he had been continually
impelled while passing through the streets. He entered
the accustomed room, and looked around him on its books, its
windows, its fireplace, and the tapestried comfort of the walls,
with the same perception of strangeness that had haunted him<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[274]" id="pgepubid00292"><a id="Page_274" title="[274]"></a></span>
throughout his walk from the forest-dell into the town, and
thitherward. Here he had studied and written; here, gone
through fast and vigil, and come forth half alive; here, striven
to pray; here, borne a hundred thousand agonies! There was
the Bible, in its rich old Hebrew, with Moses and the Prophets
speaking to him, and God’s voice through all! There, on the
table, with the inky pen beside it, was an unfinished sermon,
with a sentence broken in the midst, where his thoughts had
ceased to gush out upon the page, two days before. He knew
that it was himself, the thin and white-cheeked minister, who
had done and suffered these things, and written thus far into
the Election Sermon! But he seemed to stand apart, and eye
this former self with scornful, pitying, but half-envious curiosity.
That self was gone. Another man had returned out of the forest;
a wiser one; with a knowledge of hidden mysteries which the
simplicity of the former never could have reached. A bitter
kind of knowledge that!</p>
<p>While occupied with these reflections, a knock came at the
door of the study, and the minister said, “Come in!”—not
wholly devoid of an idea that he might behold an evil spirit.
And so he did! It was old Roger Chillingworth that entered.
The minister stood, white and speechless, with one hand on the
Hebrew Scriptures, and the other spread upon his breast.</p>
<p>“Welcome home, reverend Sir,” said the physician. “And how
found you that godly man, the Apostle Eliot? But methinks,
dear Sir, you look pale; as if the travel through the wilderness had
been too sore for you. Will not my aid be requisite to put
you in heart and strength to preach your Election Sermon?”</p>
<p>“Nay, I think not so,” rejoined the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale.
“My journey, and the sight of the holy Apostle yonder,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[275]" id="pgepubid00293"><a id="Page_275" title="[275]"></a></span>
and the free air which I have breathed, have done me good,
after so long confinement in my study. I think to need no
more of your drugs, my kind physician, good though they be,
and administered by a friendly hand.”</p>
<p>All this time, Roger Chillingworth was looking at the minister
with the grave and intent regard of a physician towards
his patient. But, in spite of this outward show, the latter was
almost convinced of the old man’s knowledge, or, at least, his
confident suspicion, with respect to his own interview with Hester
Prynne. The physician knew then, that, in the minister’s regard,
he was no longer a trusted friend, but his bitterest enemy. So
much being known, it would appear natural that a part of it
should be expressed. It is singular, however, how long a time
often passes before words embody things; and with what security
two persons, who choose to avoid a certain subject, may approach
its very verge, and retire without disturbing it. Thus, the
minister felt no apprehension that Roger Chillingworth would
touch, in express words, upon the real position which they sustained
towards one another. Yet did the physician, in his dark
way, creep frightfully near the secret.</p>
<p>“Were it not better,” said he, “that you use my poor skill
to-night? Verily, dear Sir, we must take pains to make you
strong and vigorous for this occasion of the Election discourse.
The people look for great things from you; apprehending that
another year may come about, and find their pastor gone.”</p>
<p>“Yea, to another world,” replied the minister, with pious
resignation. “Heaven grant it be a better one; for, in good
sooth, I hardly think to tarry with my flock through the flitting
seasons of another year! But, touching your medicine, kind
Sir, in my present frame of body, I need it not.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[276]" id="pgepubid00294"><a id="Page_276" title="[276]"></a></span>”</p>
<p>“I joy to hear it,” answered the physician. “It may be
that my remedies, so long administered in vain, begin now to
take due effect. Happy man were I, and well deserving of New
England’s gratitude, could I achieve this cure!”</p>
<p>“I thank you from my heart, most watchful friend,” said the
Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, with a solemn smile. “I thank you,
and can but requite your good deeds with my prayers.”</p>
<p>“A good man’s prayers are golden recompense!” rejoined
old Roger Chillingworth, as he took his leave. “Yea, they are
the current gold coin of the New Jerusalem, with the King’s
own mint-mark on them!”</p>
<p>Left alone, the minister summoned a servant of the house,
and requested food, which, being set before him, he ate with
ravenous appetite. Then, flinging the already written pages of
the Election Sermon into the fire, he forthwith began another,
which he wrote with such an impulsive flow of thought and
emotion, that he fancied himself inspired; and only wondered
that Heaven should see fit to transmit the grand and solemn
music of its oracles through so foul an organ-pipe as he. However,
leaving that mystery to solve itself, or go unsolved forever,
he drove his task onward, with earnest haste and ecstasy. Thus
the night fled away, as if it were a winged steed, and he careering
on it; morning came, and peeped, blushing, through the
curtains; and at last sunrise threw a golden beam into the
study and laid it right across the minister’s bedazzled eyes.
There he was, with the pen still between his fingers, and a vast,
immeasurable tract of written space behind him!</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">etimes</span> in the morning of the day on which
the new Governor was to receive his office at
the hands of the people, Hester Prynne and
little Pearl came into the market-place. It
was already thronged with the craftsmen and
other plebeian inhabitants of the town, in
considerable numbers; among whom, likewise, were many rough
figures, whose attire of deer-skins marked them as belonging to
some of the forest settlements, which surrounded the little metropolis
of the colony.</p>
<p>On this public holiday, as on all other occasions, for seven
years past, Hester was clad in a garment of coarse gray cloth.
Not more by its hue than by some indescribable peculiarity in
its fashion, it had the effect of making her fade personally out
of sight and outline; while, again, the scarlet letter brought
her back from this twilight indistinctness, and revealed her
under the moral aspect of its own illumination. Her face, so
long familiar to the towns-people, showed the marble quietude
which they were accustomed to behold there. It was like a<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[278]" id="pgepubid00298"><a id="Page_278" title="[278]"></a></span>
mask; or, rather, like the frozen calmness of a dead woman’s
features; owing this dreary resemblance to the fact that Hester
was actually dead, in respect to any claim of sympathy, and
had departed out of the world with which she still seemed to
mingle.</p>
<p>It might be, on this one day, that there was an expression
unseen before, nor, indeed, vivid enough to be detected now;
unless some preternaturally gifted observer should have first read
the heart, and have afterwards sought a corresponding development
in the countenance and mien. Such a spiritual seer might
have conceived, that, after sustaining the gaze of the multitude
through seven miserable years as a necessity, a penance, and
something which it was a stern religion to endure, she now, for
one last time more, encountered it freely and voluntarily, in
order to convert what had so long been agony into a kind of
triumph. “Look your last on the scarlet letter and its wearer!”—the
people’s victim and life-long bond-slave, as they fancied
her, might say to them. “Yet a little while, and she will be
beyond your reach! A few hours longer, and the deep, mysterious
ocean will quench and hide forever the symbol which ye
have caused to burn upon her bosom!” Nor were it an inconsistency
too improbable to be assigned to human nature, should
we suppose a feeling of regret in Hester’s mind, at the moment
when she was about to win her freedom from the pain which
had been thus deeply incorporated with her being. Might there
not be an irresistible desire to quaff a last, long, breathless
draught of the cup of wormwood and aloes, with which nearly
all her years of womanhood had been perpetually flavored? The
wine of life, henceforth to be presented to her lips, must be
indeed rich, delicious, and exhilarating, in its chased and golden<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[279]" id="pgepubid00299"><a id="Page_279" title="[279]"></a></span>
beaker; or else leave an inevitable and weary languor, after the
lees of bitterness wherewith she had been drugged, as with a
cordial of intensest potency.</p>
<p>Pearl was decked out with airy gayety. It would have been
impossible to guess that this bright and sunny apparition owed
its existence to the shape of gloomy gray; or that a fancy, at
once so gorgeous and so delicate as must have been requisite to
contrive the child’s apparel, was the same that had achieved a
task perhaps more difficult, in imparting so distinct a peculiarity
to Hester’s simple robe. The dress, so proper was it to little
Pearl, seemed an effluence, or inevitable development and outward
manifestation of her character, no more to be separated
from her than the many-hued brilliancy from a butterfly’s wing,
or the painted glory from the leaf of a bright flower. As with
these, so with the child; her garb was all of one idea with her
nature. On this eventful day, moreover, there was a certain
singular inquietude and excitement in her mood, resembling
nothing so much as the shimmer of a diamond, that sparkles
and flashes with the varied throbbings of the breast on which
it is displayed. Children have always a sympathy in the agitations
of those connected with them; always, especially, a sense
of any trouble or impending revolution, of whatever kind, in
domestic circumstances; and therefore Pearl, who was the gem
on her mother’s unquiet bosom, betrayed, by the very dance of
her spirits, the emotions which none could detect in the marble
passiveness of Hester’s brow.</p>
<p>This effervescence made her flit with a bird-like movement,
rather than walk by her mother’s side. She broke continually
into shouts of a wild, inarticulate, and sometimes piercing music.
When they reached the market-place, she became still more restless,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[280]" id="pgepubid00300"><a id="Page_280" title="[280]"></a></span>
on perceiving the stir and bustle that enlivened the spot;
for it was usually more like the broad and lonesome green
before a village meeting-house, than the centre of a town’s
business.</p>
<p>“Why, what is this, mother?” cried she. “Wherefore have
all the people left their work to-day? Is it a play-day for the
whole world? See, there is the blacksmith! He has washed
his sooty face, and put on his Sabbath-day clothes, and looks
as if he would gladly be merry, if any kind body would only
teach him how! And there is Master Brackett, the old jailer,
nodding and smiling at me. Why does he do so, mother?”</p>
<p>“He remembers thee a little babe, my child,” answered
Hester.</p>
<p>“He should not nod and smile at me, for all that,—the
black, grim, ugly-eyed old man!” said Pearl. “He may nod
at thee, if he will; for thou art clad in gray, and wearest the
scarlet letter. But see, mother, how many faces of strange
people, and Indians among them, and sailors! What have they
all come to do, here in the market-place?”</p>
<p>“They wait to see the procession pass,” said Hester. “For
the Governor and the magistrates are to go by, and the ministers,
and all the great people and good people, with the music
and the soldiers marching before them.”</p>
<p>“And will the minister be there?” asked Pearl. “And
will he hold out both his hands to me, as when thou ledst me
to him from the brook-side?”</p>
<p>“He will be there, child,” answered her mother. “But he
will not greet thee to-day; nor must thou greet him.”</p>
<p>“What a strange, sad man is he!” said the child, as if speaking
partly to herself. “In the dark night-time he calls us to<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[281]" id="pgepubid00301"><a id="Page_281" title="[281]"></a></span>
him, and holds thy hand and mine, as when we stood with him
on the scaffold yonder. And in the deep forest, where only the
old trees can hear, and the strip of sky see it, he talks with
thee, sitting on a heap of moss! And he kisses my forehead,
too, so that the little brook would hardly wash it off! But
here, in the sunny day, and among all the people, he knows
us not; nor must we know him! A strange, sad man is he,
with his hand always over his heart!”</p>
<p>“Be quiet, Pearl! Thou understandest not these things,”
said her mother. “Think not now of the minister, but look
about thee, and see how cheery is everybody’s face to-day. The
children have come from their schools, and the grown people
from their workshops and their fields, on purpose to be happy.
For, to-day, a new man is beginning to rule over them; and
so—as has been the custom of mankind ever since a nation
was first gathered—they make merry and rejoice; as if a good
and golden year were at length to pass over the poor old
world!”</p>
<p>It was as Hester said, in regard to the unwonted jollity that
brightened the faces of the people. Into this festal season of
the year—as it already was, and continued to be during the
greater part of two centuries—the Puritans compressed whatever
mirth and public joy they deemed allowable to human
infirmity; thereby so far dispelling the customary cloud, that,
for the space of a single holiday, they appeared scarcely more
grave than most other communities at a period of general
affliction.</p>
<p>But we perhaps exaggerate the gray or sable tinge, which
undoubtedly characterized the mood and manners of the age.
The persons now in the market-place of Boston had not been<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[282]" id="pgepubid00302"><a id="Page_282" title="[282]"></a></span>
born to an inheritance of Puritanic gloom. They were native
Englishmen, whose fathers had lived in the sunny richness of the
Elizabethan epoch; a time when the life of England, viewed as
one great mass, would appear to have been as stately, magnificent,
and joyous, as the world has ever witnessed. Had they
followed their hereditary taste, the New England settlers would
have illustrated all events of public importance by bonfires, banquets,
pageantries, and processions. Nor would it have been
impracticable, in the observance of majestic ceremonies, to combine
mirthful recreation with solemnity, and give, as it were,
a grotesque and brilliant embroidery to the great robe of
state, which a nation, at such festivals, puts on. There was
some shadow of an attempt of this kind in the mode of celebrating
the day on which the political year of the colony
commenced. The dim reflection of a remembered splendor, a
colorless and manifold diluted repetition of what they had beheld
in proud old London,—we will not say at a royal coronation,
but at a Lord Mayor’s show,—might be traced in the customs
which our forefathers instituted, with reference to the
annual installation of magistrates. The fathers and founders
of the commonwealth—the statesman, the priest, and the soldier—deemed
it a duty then to assume the outward state and
majesty, which, in accordance with antique style, was looked
upon as the proper garb of public or social eminence. All came
forth, to move in procession before the people’s eye, and thus
impart a needed dignity to the simple framework of a government
so newly constructed.</p>
<p>Then, too, the people were countenanced, if not encouraged,
in relaxing the severe and close application to their various
modes of rugged industry, which, at all other times, seemed of<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[283]" id="pgepubid00303"><a id="Page_283" title="[283]"></a></span>
the same piece and material with their religion. Here, it is
true, were none of the applicances which popular merriment
would so readily have found in the England of Elizabeth’s
time, or that of James;—no rude shows of a theatrical kind;
no minstrel, with his harp and legendary ballad, nor gleeman,
with an ape dancing to his music; no juggler, with his tricks
of mimic witchcraft; no Merry Andrew, to stir up the multitude
with jests, perhaps hundreds of years old, but still effective,
by their appeals to the very broadest sources of mirthful sympathy.
All such professors of the several branches of jocularity
would have been sternly repressed, not only by the rigid discipline
of law, but by the general sentiment which gives law its
vitality. Not the less, however, the great, honest face of the
people smiled, grimly, perhaps, but widely too. Nor were sports
wanting, such as the colonists had witnessed, and shared in, long
ago, at the country fairs and on the village-greens of England;
and which it was thought well to keep alive on this new soil,
for the sake of the courage and manliness that were essential
in them. Wrestling-matches, in the different fashions of Cornwall
and Devonshire, were seen here and there about the market-place;
in one corner, there was a friendly bout at quarterstaff;
and—what attracted most interest of all—on the platform of
the pillory, already so noted in our pages, two masters of defence
were commencing an exhibition with the buckler and broadsword.
But, much to the disappointment of the crowd, this latter business
was broken off by the interposition of the town beadle,
who had no idea of permitting the majesty of the law to be
violated by such an abuse of one of its consecrated places.</p>
<p>It may not be too much to affirm, on the whole, (the people
being then in the first stages of joyless deportment, and the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[284]" id="pgepubid00304"><a id="Page_284" title="[284]"></a></span>
offspring of sires who had known how to be merry, in their
day,) that they would compare favorably, in point of holiday
keeping, with their descendants, even at so long an interval as
ourselves. Their immediate posterity, the generation next to the
early emigrants, wore the blackest shade of Puritanism, and so
darkened the national visage with it, that all the subsequent
years have not sufficed to clear it up. We have yet to learn
again the forgotten art of gayety.</p>
<p>The picture of human life in the market-place, though its
general tint was the sad gray, brown, or black of the English
emigrants, was yet enlivened by some diversity of hue. A party
of Indians—in their savage finery of curiously embroidered
deer-skin robes, wampum-belts, red and yellow ochre, and
feathers, and armed with the bow and arrow and stone-headed
spear—stood apart, with countenances of inflexible gravity,
beyond what even the Puritan aspect could attain. Nor, wild
as were these painted barbarians, were they the wildest feature
of the scene. This distinction could more justly be claimed by
some mariners,—a part of the crew of the vessel from the
Spanish Main,—who had come ashore to see the humors of
Election Day. They were rough-looking desperadoes, with sun-blackened
faces, and an immensity of beard; their wide, short
trousers were confined about the waist by belts, often clasped
with a rough plate of gold, and sustaining always a long knife,
and, in some instances, a sword. From beneath their broad-brimmed
hats of palm-leaf gleamed eyes which, even in good-nature
and merriment, had a kind of animal ferocity. They
transgressed, without fear or scruple, the rules of behavior that
were binding on all others; smoking tobacco under the beadle’s
very nose, although each whiff would have cost a townsman a<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[285]" id="pgepubid00305"><a id="Page_285" title="[285]"></a></span>
shilling; and quaffing, at their pleasure, draughts of wine or
aqua-vitæ from pocket-flasks, which they freely tendered to the
gaping crowd around them. It remarkably characterized the
incomplete morality of the age, rigid as we call it, that a license
was allowed the seafaring class, not merely for their freaks on
shore, but for far more desperate deeds on their proper element.
The sailor of that day would go near to be arraigned as a
pirate in our own. There could be little doubt, for instance,
that this very ship’s crew, though no unfavorable specimens of
the nautical brotherhood, had been guilty, as we should phrase
it, of depredations on the Spanish commerce, such as would
have perilled all their necks in a modern court of justice.</p>
<p>But the sea, in those old times, heaved, swelled, and foamed,
very much at its own will, or subject only to the tempestuous
wind, with hardly any attempts at regulation by human law.
The buccaneer on the wave might relinquish his calling, and
become at once, if he chose, a man of probity and piety on
land; nor, even in the full career of his reckless life, was he
regarded as a personage with whom it was disreputable to traffic,
or casually associate. Thus, the Puritan elders, in their black
cloaks, starched bands, and steeple-crowned hats, smiled not
unbenignantly at the clamor and rude deportment of these jolly
seafaring men; and it excited neither surprise nor animadversion,
when so reputable a citizen as old Roger Chillingworth, the
physician, was seen to enter the market-place, in close and
familiar talk with the commander of the questionable vessel.</p>
<p>The latter was by far the most showy and gallant figure, so
far as apparel went, anywhere to be seen among the multitude.
He wore a profusion of ribbons on his garment, and gold-lace
on his hat, which was also encircled by a gold chain, and surmounted<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[286]" id="pgepubid00306"><a id="Page_286" title="[286]"></a></span>
with a feather. There was a sword at his side, and a
sword-cut on his forehead, which, by the arrangement of his
hair, he seemed anxious rather to display than hide. A landsman
could hardly have worn this garb and shown this face, and
worn and shown them both with such a galliard air, without
undergoing stern question before a magistrate, and probably
incurring fine or imprisonment, or perhaps an exhibition in the
stocks. As regarded the shipmaster, however, all was looked
upon as pertaining to the character, as to a fish his glistening
scales.</p>
<p>After parting from the physician, the commander of the Bristol
ship strolled idly through the market-place; until, happening to
approach the spot where Hester Prynne was standing, he appeared
to recognize, and did not hesitate to address her. As was usually
the case wherever Hester stood, a small vacant area—a sort of
magic circle—had formed itself about her, into which, though
the people were elbowing one another at a little distance, none
ventured, or felt disposed to intrude. It was a forcible type of
the moral solitude in which the scarlet letter enveloped its fated
wearer; partly by her own reserve, and partly by the instinctive,
though no longer so unkindly, withdrawal of her fellow-creatures.
Now, if never before, it answered a good purpose,
by enabling Hester and the seaman to speak together without
risk of being overheard; and so changed was Hester Prynne’s
repute before the public, that the matron in town most eminent
for rigid morality could not have held such intercourse with less
result of scandal than herself.</p>

<p>“So, mistress,” said the mariner, “I must bid the steward
make ready one more berth than you bargained for! No fear
of scurvy or ship-fever, this voyage! What with the ship’s
surgeon and this other doctor, our only danger will be from
drug or pill; more by token, as there is a lot of apothecary’s
stuff aboard, which I traded for with a Spanish vessel.”</p>
<p>“What mean you?” inquired Hester, startled more than she
permitted to appear. “Have you another passenger?”</p>
<p>“Why, know you not,” cried the shipmaster, “that this physician
here—Chillingworth, he calls himself—is minded to try
my cabin-fare with you?
Ay, ay, you must have
known it; for he tells
me he is of your party,
and a close friend to the
gentleman you spoke of,—he
that is in peril
from these sour old Puritan
rulers!”</p>
<p>“They know each
other well, indeed,” replied
Hester, with a
mien of calmness, though
in the utmost consternation.
“They have long dwelt together.”</p>
<p>Nothing further passed between the mariner and Hester Prynne.
But, at that instant, she beheld old Roger Chillingworth himself,
standing in the remotest corner of the market-place, and smiling
on her; a smile which—across the wide and bustling square,
and through all the talk and laughter, and various thoughts,
moods, and interests of the crowd—conveyed secret and fearful
meaning.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00310">THE PROCESSION.</h4>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">efore</span> Hester Prynne could call together her
thoughts, and consider what was practicable
to be done in this new and startling aspect
of affairs, the sound of military music was
heard approaching along a contiguous street.
It denoted the advance of the procession of
magistrates and citizens, on its way towards the meeting-house;
where, in compliance with a custom thus early established, and
ever since observed, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale was to deliver<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[289]"><a id="Page_289" title="[289]"></a></span>
an Election Sermon.</p>
<div class="backleft" style="background-image: url(file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_289.jpg); height: 100%;" id="id-3965000400458561798">
<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:400px; height:170px;"> </div>
<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:290px; height:120px;"> </div>
<p>Soon the head of the procession showed itself, with a slow
and stately march, turning a corner, and making its way across
the market-place. First came the music. It comprised a variety
of instruments, perhaps imperfectly adapted to one another, and
played with no great skill; but yet attaining the great object
for which the harmony of drum and clarion addresses itself to
the multitude,—that of imparting a higher and more heroic air
to the scene of life that passes before the eye. Little Pearl at
first clapped her hands, but then lost, for an instant, the restless
agitation that had kept her in a continual effervescence
throughout the morning; she gazed silently, and seemed to be
borne upward, like a floating sea-bird, on the long heaves and
swells of sound. But she was brought back to her former
mood by the shimmer of the sunshine on the weapons and bright
armor of the military company, which followed after the music,
and formed the honorary escort of the procession. This body
of soldiery—which still sustains a corporate existence, and
marches down from past ages with an ancient and honorable
fame—was composed of no mercenary materials. Its ranks
were filled with
gentlemen, who
felt the stirrings
of martial impulse,
and sought
to establish a
kind of College of Arms, where, as in an association of Knights
Templars, they might learn the science, and, so far as peaceful
exercise would teach them, the practices of war. The high
estimation then placed upon the military character might be<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[290]" id="pgepubid00311"><a id="Page_290" title="[290]"></a></span>
seen in the lofty port of each individual member of the company.
Some of them, indeed, by their services in the Low Countries
and on other fields of European warfare, had fairly won their
title to assume the name and pomp of soldiership. The entire
array, moreover, clad in burnished steel, and with plumage nodding
over their bright morions, had a brilliancy of effect which
no modern display can aspire to equal.</p>
</div>
<p>And yet the men of civil eminence, who came immediately
behind the military escort, were better worth a thoughtful
observer’s eye. Even in outward demeanor, they showed a stamp
of majesty that made the warrior’s haughty stride look vulgar,
if not absurd. It was an age when what we call talent had
far less consideration than now, but the massive materials which
produce stability and dignity of character a great deal more.
The people possessed, by hereditary right, the quality of reverence;
which, in their descendants, if it survive at all, exists in
smaller proportion, and with a vastly diminished force, in the
selection and estimate of public men. The change may be for
good or ill, and is partly, perhaps, for both. In that old day,
the English settler on these rude shores—having left king,
nobles, and all degrees of awful rank behind, while still the
faculty and necessity of reverence were strong in him—bestowed
it on the white hair and venerable brow of age; on long-tried
integrity; on solid wisdom and sad-colored experience; on
endowments of that grave and weighty order which gives the
idea of permanence, and comes under the general definition of
respectability. These primitive statesmen, therefore,—Bradstreet,
Endicott, Dudley, Bellingham, and their compeers,—who were
elevated to power by the early choice of the people, seem to
have been not often brilliant, but distinguished by a ponderous<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[291]" id="pgepubid00312"><a id="Page_291" title="[291]"></a></span>
sobriety, rather than activity of intellect. They had fortitude
and self-reliance, and, in time of difficulty or peril, stood up
for the welfare of the state like a line of cliffs against a tempestuous
tide. The traits of character here indicated were well
represented in the square cast of countenance and large physical
development of the new colonial magistrates. So far as a
demeanor of natural authority was concerned, the mother country
need not have been ashamed to see these foremost men of an
actual democracy adopted into the House of Peers, or made
the Privy Council of the sovereign.</p>
<p>Next in order to the magistrates came the young and eminently
distinguished divine, from whose lips the religious discourse
of the anniversary was expected. His was the profession,
at that era, in which intellectual ability displayed itself far more
than in political life; for—leaving a higher motive out of the
question—it offered inducements powerful enough, in the almost
worshipping respect of the community, to win the most aspiring
ambition into its service. Even political power—as in the case
of Increase Mather—was within the grasp of a successful priest.</p>
<p>It was the observation of those who beheld him now, that
never, since Mr. Dimmesdale first set his foot on the New
England shore, had he exhibited such energy as was seen in the
gait and air with which he kept his pace in the procession.
There was no feebleness of step, as at other times; his frame
was not bent; nor did his hand rest ominously upon his heart.
Yet, if the clergyman were rightly viewed, his strength seemed
not of the body. It might be spiritual, and imparted to him
by angelic ministrations. It might be the exhilaration of that
potent cordial, which is distilled only in the furnace-glow of
earnest and long-continued thought. Or, perchance, his sensitive<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[292]" id="pgepubid00313"><a id="Page_292" title="[292]"></a></span>
temperament was invigorated by the loud and piercing music,
that swelled heavenward, and uplifted him on its ascending wave.
Nevertheless, so abstracted was his look, it might be questioned
whether Mr. Dimmesdale even heard the music. There was his
body, moving onward, and with an unaccustomed force. But
where was his mind? Far and deep in its own region, busying
itself, with preternatural activity, to marshal a procession of
stately thoughts that were soon to issue thence; and so he saw
nothing, heard nothing, knew nothing, of what was around him;
but the spiritual element took up the feeble frame, and carried
it along, unconscious of the burden, and converting it to spirit
like itself. Men of uncommon intellect, who have grown morbid,
possess this occasional power of mighty effort, into which they
throw the life of many days, and then are lifeless for as many
more.</p>
<p>Hester Prynne, gazing steadfastly at the clergyman, felt a
dreary influence come over her, but wherefore or whence she
knew not; unless that he seemed so remote from her own
sphere, and utterly beyond her reach. One glance of recognition,
she had imagined, must needs pass between them. She
thought of the dim forest, with its little dell of solitude, and
love, and anguish, and the mossy tree-trunk, where, sitting hand
in hand, they had mingled their sad and passionate talk with
the melancholy murmur of the brook. How deeply had they
known each other then! And was this the man? She hardly
knew him now! He, moving proudly past, enveloped, as it
were, in the rich music, with the procession of majestic and
venerable fathers; he, so unattainable in his worldly position,
and still more so in that far vista of his unsympathizing
thoughts, through which she now beheld him! Her spirit sank<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[293]" id="pgepubid00314"><a id="Page_293" title="[293]"></a></span>
with the idea that all must have been a delusion, and that,
vividly as she had dreamed it, there could be no real bond
betwixt the clergyman and herself. And thus much of woman
was there in Hester, that she could scarcely forgive him,—least
of all now, when the heavy footstep of their approaching
Fate might be heard, nearer, nearer, nearer!—for being able
so completely to withdraw himself from their mutual world;
while she groped darkly, and stretched forth her cold hands,
and found him not.</p>
<p>Pearl either saw and responded to her mother’s feelings, or
herself felt the remoteness and intangibility that had fallen
around the minister. While the procession passed, the child
was uneasy, fluttering up and down, like a bird on the point
of taking flight. When the whole had gone by, she looked up
into Hester’s face.</p>
<p>“Mother,” said she, “was that the same minister that kissed
me by the brook?”</p>
<p>“Hold thy peace, dear little Pearl!” whispered her mother.
“We must not always talk in the market-place of what happens
to us in the forest.”</p>
<p>“I could not be sure that it was he; so strange he looked,”
continued the child. “Else I would have run to him, and bid
him kiss me now, before all the people; even as he did yonder
among the dark old trees. What would the minister have said,
mother? Would he have clapped his hand over his heart, and
scowled on me, and bid me be gone?”</p>
<p>“What should he say, Pearl,” answered Hester, “save that
it was no time to kiss, and that kisses are not to be given in
the market-place? Well for thee, foolish child, that thou didst
not speak to him!<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[294]" id="pgepubid00315"><a id="Page_294" title="[294]"></a></span>”</p>
<p>Another shade of the same sentiment, in reference to Mr.
Dimmesdale, was expressed by a person whose eccentricities—or
insanity, as we should term it—led her to do what few of
the towns-people would have ventured on; to begin a conversation
with the wearer of the scarlet letter, in public. It was
Mistress Hibbins, who, arrayed in great magnificence, with a
triple ruff, a broidered stomacher, a gown of rich velvet, and
a gold-headed cane, had come forth to see the procession. As
this ancient lady had the renown (which subsequently cost her
no less a price than her life) of being a principal actor in all
the works of necromancy that were continually going forward,
the crowd gave way before her, and seemed to fear the touch
of her garment, as if it carried the plague among its gorgeous
folds. Seen in conjunction with Hester Prynne,—kindly as so
many now felt towards the latter,—the dread inspired by Mistress
Hibbins was doubled, and caused a general movement
from that part of the market-place in which the two women
stood.</p>
<p>“Now, what mortal imagination could conceive it!” whispered
the old lady, confidentially, to Hester. “Yonder divine
man! That saint on earth, as the people uphold him to be,
and as—I must needs say—he really looks! Who, now, that
saw him pass in the procession, would think how little while it
is since he went forth out of his study,—chewing a Hebrew
text of Scripture in his mouth, I warrant,—to take an airing
in the forest! Aha! we know what that means, Hester Prynne!
But, truly, forsooth, I find it hard to believe him the same
man. Many a church-member saw I, walking behind the music,
that has danced in the same measure with me, when Somebody
was fiddler, and, it might be, an Indian powwow or a Lapland<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[295]" id="pgepubid00316"><a id="Page_295" title="[295]"></a></span>
wizard changing hands with us! That is but a trifle, when a
woman knows the world. But this minister! Couldst thou
surely tell, Hester, whether he was the same man that encountered
thee on the forest-path?”</p>
<p>“Madam, I know not of what you speak,” answered Hester
Prynne, feeling Mistress Hibbins to be of infirm mind; yet
strangely startled and awe-stricken by the confidence with which
she affirmed a personal connection between so many persons (herself
among them) and the Evil One. “It is not for me to
talk lightly of a learned and pious minister of the Word, like
the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale!”</p>
<p>“Fie, woman, fie!” cried the old lady, shaking her finger at
Hester. “Dost thou think I have been to the forest so many
times, and have yet no skill to judge who else has been there?
Yea; though no leaf of the wild garlands, which they wore
while they danced, be left in their hair! I know thee, Hester;
for I behold the token. We may all see it in the sunshine;
and it glows like a red flame in the dark. Thou wearest it
openly; so there need be no question about that. But this
minister! Let me tell thee, in thine ear! When the Black
Man sees one of his own servants, signed and sealed, so shy
of owning to the bond as is the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, he
hath a way of ordering matters so that the mark shall be disclosed
in open daylight to the eyes of all the world! What is
it that the minister seeks to hide, with his hand always over
his heart? Ha, Hester Prynne!”</p>
<p>“What is it, good Mistress Hibbins?” eagerly asked little
Pearl. “Hast thou seen it?”</p>
<p>“No matter, darling!” responded Mistress Hibbins, making
Pearl a profound reverence. “Thou thyself wilt see it, one time<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[296]" id="pgepubid00317"><a id="Page_296" title="[296]"></a></span>
or another. They say, child, thou art of the lineage of the
Prince of the Air! Wilt thou ride with me, some fine night,
to see thy father? Then thou shalt know wherefore the minister
keeps his hand over his heart!”</p>
<p>Laughing so shrilly that all the market-place could hear her,
the weird old gentlewoman took her departure.</p>
<p>By this time the preliminary prayer had been offered in the
meeting-house, and the accents of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale
were heard commencing his discourse. An irresistible feeling
kept Hester near the spot. As the sacred edifice was too
much thronged to admit another auditor, she took up her position
close beside the scaffold of the pillory. It was in sufficient
proximity to bring the whole sermon to her ears, in the shape
of an indistinct, but varied, murmur and flow of the minister’s
very peculiar voice.</p>
<p>This vocal organ was in itself a rich endowment; insomuch
that a listener, comprehending nothing of the language in which
the preacher spoke, might still have been swayed to and fro by
the mere tone and cadence. Like all other music, it breathed
passion and pathos, and emotions high or tender, in a tongue
native to the human heart, wherever educated. Muffled as the
sound was by its passage through the church-walls, Hester
Prynne listened with such intentness, and sympathized so intimately,
that the sermon had throughout a meaning for her,
entirely apart from its indistinguishable words. These, perhaps,
if more distinctly heard, might have been only a grosser medium,
and have clogged the spiritual sense. Now she caught the low
undertone, as of the wind sinking down to repose itself; then
ascended with it, as it rose through progressive gradations of
sweetness and power, until its volume seemed to envelop her<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[297]" id="pgepubid00318"><a id="Page_297" title="[297]"></a></span>
with an atmosphere of awe and solemn grandeur. And yet,
majestic as the voice sometimes became, there was forever in it
an essential character of plaintiveness. A loud or low expression
of anguish,—the whisper, or the shriek, as it might be
conceived, of suffering humanity, that touched a sensibility in
every bosom! At times this deep strain of pathos was all that
could be heard, and scarcely heard, sighing amid a desolate
silence. But even when the minister’s voice grew high and
commanding,—when it gushed irrepressibly upward,—when it
assumed its utmost breadth and power, so overfilling the church
as to burst its way through the solid walls, and diffuse itself in
the open air,—still, if the auditor listened intently, and for the
purpose, he could detect the same cry of pain. What was it?
The complaint of a human heart, sorrow-laden, perchance guilty,
telling its secret, whether of guilt or sorrow, to the great heart
of mankind; beseeching its sympathy or forgiveness,—at every
moment,—in each accent,—and never in vain! It was this
profound and continual undertone that gave the clergyman his
most appropriate power.</p>
<p>During all this time, Hester stood, statue-like, at the foot of
the scaffold. If the minister’s voice had not kept her there,
there would nevertheless have been an inevitable magnetism in
that spot, whence she dated the first hour of her life of ignominy.
There was a sense within her,—too ill-defined to be made a
thought, but weighing heavily on her mind,—that her whole
orb of life, both before and after, was connected with this spot,
as with the one point that gave it unity.</p>
<p>Little Pearl, meanwhile, had quitted her mother’s side, and
was playing at her own will about the market-place. She made
the sombre crowd cheerful by her erratic and glistening ray;<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[298]" id="pgepubid00319"><a id="Page_298" title="[298]"></a></span>
even as a bird of bright plumage illuminates a whole tree of
dusky foliage, by darting to and fro, half seen and half concealed
amid the twilight of the clustering leaves. She had an
undulating, but, oftentimes, a sharp and irregular movement. It
indicated the restless vivacity of her spirit, which to-day was
doubly indefatigable in its tiptoe dance, because it was played
upon and vibrated with her mother’s disquietude. Whenever
Pearl saw anything to excite her ever-active and wandering
curiosity, she flew thitherward and, as we might say, seized
upon that man or thing as her own property, so far as she
desired it; but without yielding the minutest degree of control
over her motions in requital. The Puritans looked on, and, if
they smiled, were none the less inclined to pronounce the child
a demon offspring, from the indescribable charm of beauty and
eccentricity that shone through her little figure, and sparkled
with its activity. She ran and looked the wild Indian in the
face; and he grew conscious of a nature wilder than his own.
Thence, with native audacity, but still with a reserve as characteristic,
she flew into the midst of a group of mariners, the
swarthy-cheeked wild men of the ocean, as the Indians were of
the land; and they gazed wonderingly and admiringly at Pearl,
as if a flake of the sea-foam had taken the shape of a little
maid, and were gifted with a soul of the sea-fire, that flashes
beneath the prow in the night-time.</p>
<p>One of these seafaring men—the shipmaster, indeed, who had
spoken to Hester Prynne—was so smitten with Pearl’s aspect,
that he attempted to lay hands upon her, with purpose to snatch
a kiss. Finding it as impossible to touch her as to catch a
humming-bird in the air, he took from his hat the gold chain
that was twisted about it, and threw it to the child. Pearl<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[299]" id="pgepubid00320"><a id="Page_299" title="[299]"></a></span>
immediately twined it around her neck and waist, with such
happy skill, that, once seen there, it became a part of her, and
it was difficult to imagine her without it.</p>
<p>“Thy mother is yonder woman with the scarlet letter,” said
the seaman. “Wilt thou carry her a message from me?”</p>
<p>“If the message pleases me, I will,” answered Pearl.</p>
<p>“Then tell her,” rejoined he, “that I spake again with the
black-a-visaged, hump-shouldered old doctor, and he engages to
bring his friend, the gentleman she wots of, aboard with him.
So let thy mother take no thought, save for herself and thee.
Wilt thou tell her this, thou witch-baby?”</p>
<p>“Mistress Hibbins says my father is the Prince of the Air!”
cried Pearl, with a naughty smile. “If thou callest me that
ill name, I shall tell him of thee; and he will chase thy ship
with a tempest!”</p>
<p>Pursuing a zigzag course across the market-place, the child
returned to her mother, and communicated what the mariner
had said. Hester’s strong, calm, steadfastly enduring spirit
almost sank, at last, on beholding this dark and grim countenance
of an inevitable doom, which—at the moment when a
passage seemed to open for the minister and herself out of
their labyrinth of misery—showed itself, with an unrelenting
smile, right in the midst of their path.</p>
<p>With her mind harassed by the terrible perplexity in which
the shipmaster’s intelligence involved her, she was also subjected
to another trial. There were many people present, from the
country round about, who had often heard of the scarlet letter,
and to whom it had been made terrific by a hundred false or
exaggerated rumors, but who had never beheld it with their
own bodily eyes. These, after exhausting other modes of amusement,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[300]" id="pgepubid00321"><a id="Page_300" title="[300]"></a></span>
now thronged about Hester Prynne with rude and boorish
intrusiveness. Unscrupulous as it was, however, it could not
bring them nearer than a circuit of several yards. At that distance
they accordingly stood, fixed there by the centrifugal force
of the repugnance which the mystic symbol inspired. The whole
gang of sailors, likewise, observing the press of spectators, and
learning the purport of the scarlet letter, came and thrust their
sunburnt and desperado-looking faces into the ring. Even the
Indians were affected by a sort of cold shadow of the white
man’s curiosity, and, gliding through the crowd, fastened their
snake-like black eyes on Hester’s bosom; conceiving, perhaps,
that the wearer of this brilliantly embroidered badge must needs
be a personage of high dignity among her people. Lastly
the inhabitants of the town (their own interest in this worn-out
subject languidly reviving itself, by sympathy with what
they saw others feel) lounged idly to the same quarter,
and tormented Hester Prynne, perhaps more than all the rest,
with their cool, well-acquainted gaze at her familiar shame.
Hester saw and recognized the selfsame faces of that group
of matrons, who had awaited her forthcoming from the prison-door,
seven years ago; all save one, the youngest and only
compassionate among them, whose burial-robe she had since
made. At the final hour, when she was so soon to fling aside
the burning letter, it had strangely become the centre of more
remark and excitement, and was thus made to sear her breast
more painfully, than at any time since the first day she put
it on.</p>
<p>While Hester stood in that magic circle of ignominy, where
the cunning cruelty of her sentence seemed to have fixed her
forever, the admirable preacher was looking down from the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[301]" id="pgepubid00322"><a id="Page_301" title="[301]"></a></span>
sacred pulpit upon an audience whose very inmost spirits had
yielded to his control. The sainted minister in the church!
The woman of the scarlet letter in the market-place! What
imagination would have been irreverent enough to surmise that
the same scorching stigma was on them both!</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">he</span> eloquent voice, on which the souls of
the listening audience had been borne aloft
as on the swelling waves of the sea, at
length came to a pause. There was a
momentary silence, profound as what should
follow the utterance of oracles. Then ensued
a murmur and half-hushed tumult; as if the auditors,
released from the high spell that had transported them into the
region of another’s mind, were returning into themselves, with
all their awe and wonder still heavy on them. In a moment
more, the crowd began to gush forth from the doors of the
church. Now that there was an end, they needed other breath,
more fit to support the gross and earthly life into which they
relapsed, than that atmosphere which the preacher had converted
into words of flame, and had burdened with the rich
fragrance of his thought.</p>
<p>In the open air their rapture broke into speech. The street
and the market-place absolutely babbled, from side to side, with<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[303]" id="pgepubid00326"><a id="Page_303" title="[303]"></a></span>
applauses of the minister. His hearers could not rest until they
had told one another of what each knew better than he could
tell or hear. According to their united testimony, never had
man spoken in so wise, so high, and so holy a spirit, as he
that spake this day; nor had inspiration ever breathed through
mortal lips more evidently than it did through his. Its influence
could be seen, as it were, descending upon him, and
possessing him, and continually lifting him out of the written
discourse that lay before him, and filling him with ideas that
must have been as marvellous to himself as to his audience.
His subject, it appeared, had been the relation between the Deity
and the communities of mankind, with a special reference to the
New England which they were here planting in the wilderness.
And, as he drew towards the close, a spirit as of prophecy
had come upon him, constraining him to its purpose as mightily
as the old prophets of Israel were constrained; only with this
difference, that, whereas the Jewish seers had denounced judgments
and ruin on their country, it was his mission to foretell
a high and glorious destiny for the newly gathered people of
the Lord. But, throughout it all, and through the whole discourse,
there had been a certain deep, sad undertone of pathos,
which could not be interpreted otherwise than as the natural
regret of one soon to pass away. Yes; their minister whom
they so loved—and who so loved them all, that he could not
depart heavenward without a sigh—had the foreboding of
untimely death upon him, and would soon leave them in their
tears! This idea of his transitory stay on earth gave the last
emphasis to the effect which the preacher had produced; it was
as if an angel, in his passage to the skies, had shaken his
bright wings over the people for an instant,—at once a shadow<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[304]"><a id="Page_304" title="[304]"></a></span>
and a splendor,—and had shed down a shower of golden truths
upon them.</p>
<p>Thus, there had come to the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale—as
to most men, in their various spheres, though seldom recognized
until they see it far behind them—an epoch of life more
brilliant and full of triumph than any previous one, or than
any which could hereafter be. He stood, at this moment, on
the very proudest eminence of superiority, to which the gifts
of intellect, rich lore, prevailing eloquence, and a reputation of
whitest sanctity, could exalt a clergyman in New England’s earliest
days, when the professional character was of itself a lofty
pedestal. Such was the position which the minister occupied,
as he bowed his head forward on the cushions of the pulpit, at
the close of his Election Sermon. Meanwhile Hester Prynne
was standing beside the scaffold of the pillory, with the scarlet
letter still burning on her breast!</p>
<p>Now was heard again the clangor of the music, and the
measured tramp of the military escort, issuing from the church-door.
The procession was to be marshalled thence to the town-hall,
where a solemn banquet would complete the ceremonies of
the day.</p>
<p>Once more, therefore, the train of venerable and majestic
fathers was seen moving through a broad pathway of the people,
who drew back reverently, on either side, as the Governor
and magistrates, the old and wise men, the holy ministers, and
all that were eminent and renowned, advanced into the midst
of them. When they were fairly in the market-place, their
presence was greeted by a shout. This—though doubtless it
might acquire additional force and volume from the childlike
loyalty which the age awarded to its rulers—was felt to be an<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[305]" id="pgepubid00327"><a id="Page_305" title="[305]"></a></span>
irrepressible outburst of enthusiasm kindled in the auditors by
that high strain of eloquence which was yet reverberating in their
ears. Each felt the impulse in himself, and, in the same breath,
caught it from his neighbor. Within the church, it had hardly
been kept down; beneath the sky, it pealed upward to the
zenith. There were human beings enough, and enough of
highly wrought and symphonious feeling, to produce that more
impressive sound than the organ tones of the blast, or the
thunder, or the roar of the sea; even that mighty swell of
many voices, blended into one great voice by the universal
impulse which makes likewise one vast heart out of the many.
Never, from the soil of New England, had gone up such a
shout! Never, on New England soil, had stood the man so
honored by his mortal brethren as the preacher!</p>
<p>How fared it with him then? Were there not the brilliant
particles of a halo in the air about his head? So etherealized by
spirit as he was, and so apotheosized by worshipping admirers,
did his footsteps, in the procession, really tread upon the dust
of earth?</p>
<p>As the ranks of military men and civil fathers moved onward,
all eyes were turned towards the point where the minister was
seen to approach among them. The shout died into a murmur,
as one portion of the crowd after another obtained a glimpse
of him. How feeble and pale he looked, amid all his triumph!
The energy—or say, rather, the inspiration which had held
him up, until he should have delivered the sacred message that
brought its own strength along with it from heaven—was
withdrawn, now that it had so faithfully performed its office.
The glow, which they had just before beheld burning on his
cheek, was extinguished, like a flame that sinks down hopelessly<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[306]" id="pgepubid00328"><a id="Page_306" title="[306]"></a></span>
among the late-decaying embers. It seemed hardly the
face of a man alive, with such a death-like hue; it was hardly
a man with life in him, that tottered on his path so nervelessly,
yet tottered, and did not fall!</p>
<p>One of his clerical brethren,—it was the venerable John
Wilson,—observing the state in which Mr. Dimmesdale was
left by the retiring wave of intellect and sensibility, stepped
forward hastily to offer his support. The minister tremulously,
but decidedly, repelled the old man’s arm. He still walked
onward, if that movement could be so described, which rather
resembled the wavering effort of an infant, with its mother’s
arms in view, outstretched to tempt him forward. And now,
almost imperceptible as were the latter steps of his progress,
he had come opposite the well-remembered and weather-darkened
scaffold, where, long since, with all that dreary lapse of time
between, Hester Prynne had encountered the world’s ignominious
stare. There stood Hester, holding little Pearl by the hand!
And there was the scarlet letter on her breast! The minister
here made a pause; although the music still played the stately
and rejoicing march to which the procession moved. It summoned
him onward,—onward to the festival!—but here he
made a pause.</p>
<p>Bellingham, for the last few moments, had kept an anxious
eye upon him. He now left his own place in the procession,
and advanced to give assistance; judging, from Mr. Dimmesdale’s
aspect, that he must otherwise inevitably fall. But there
was something in the latter’s expression that warned back the
magistrate, although a man not readily obeying the vague intimations
that pass from one spirit to another. The crowd, meanwhile,
looked on with awe and wonder. This earthly faintness<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[307]" id="pgepubid00329"><a id="Page_307" title="[307]"></a></span>
was, in their view, only another phase of the minister’s celestial
strength; nor would it have seemed a miracle too high to be
wrought for one so holy, had he ascended before their eyes,
waxing dimmer and brighter, and fading at last into the light
of heaven.</p>
<p>He turned towards the scaffold, and stretched forth his arms.</p>
<p>“Hester,” said he, “come hither! Come, my little Pearl!”</p>
<p>It was a ghastly look with which he regarded them; but
there was something at once tender and strangely triumphant in
it. The child, with the bird-like motion which was one of her
characteristics, flew to him, and clasped her arms about his
knees. Hester Prynne—slowly, as if impelled by inevitable
fate, and against her strongest will—likewise drew near, but
paused before she reached him. At this instant, old Roger
Chillingworth thrust himself through the crowd,—or, perhaps,
so dark, disturbed, and evil, was his look, he rose up out of
some nether region,—to snatch back his victim from what he
sought to do! Be that as it might, the old man rushed forward,
and caught the minister by the arm.</p>
<p>“Madman, hold! what is your purpose?” whispered he.
“Wave back that woman! Cast off this child! All shall be
well! Do not blacken your fame, and perish in dishonor! I
can yet save you! Would you bring infamy on your sacred
profession?”</p>
<p>“Ha, tempter! Methinks thou art too late!” answered the
minister, encountering his eye, fearfully, but firmly. “Thy
power is not what it was! With God’s help, I shall escape
thee now!”</p>
<p>He again extended his hand to the woman of the scarlet letter.</p>
<p>“Hester Prynne,” cried he, with a piercing earnestness, “in<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[308]" id="pgepubid00330"><a id="Page_308" title="[308]"></a></span>
the name of Him, so terrible and so merciful, who gives me
grace, at this last moment, to do what—for my own heavy
sin and miserable agony—I withheld myself from doing seven
years ago, come hither now, and twine thy strength about me!
Thy strength, Hester; but let it be guided by the will which
God hath granted me! This wretched and wronged old man is
opposing it with all his might!—with all his own might, and the
fiend’s! Come, Hester, come! Support me up yonder scaffold!”</p>
<p>The crowd was in a tumult. The men of rank and dignity,
who stood more immediately around the clergyman, were so
taken by surprise, and so perplexed as to the purport of what
they saw,—unable to receive the explanation which most readily
presented itself, or to imagine any other,—that they remained
silent and inactive spectators of the judgment which Providence
seemed about to work. They beheld the minister, leaning on
Hester’s shoulder, and supported by her arm around him,
approach the scaffold, and ascend its steps; while still the little
hand of the sin-born child was clasped in his. Old Roger
Chillingworth followed, as one intimately connected with the
drama of guilt and sorrow in which they had all been actors,
and well entitled, therefore, to be present at its closing scene.</p>
<p>“Hadst thou sought the whole earth over,” said he, looking
darkly at the clergyman, “there was no one place so secret,—no
high place nor lowly place, where thou couldst have escaped
me,—save on this very scaffold!”</p>
<p>“Thanks be to Him who hath led me hither!” answered the
minister.</p>
<p>Yet he trembled, and turned to Hester with an expression of
doubt and anxiety in his eyes, not the less evidently betrayed,
that there was a feeble smile upon his lips.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[309]" id="pgepubid00331"><a id="Page_309" title="[309]"></a></span></p>
<p>“Is not this better,” murmured he, “than what we dreamed
of in the forest?”</p>
<p>“I know not! I know not!” she hurriedly replied. “Better?
Yea; so we may both die, and little Pearl die with us!”</p>
<p>“For thee and Pearl, be it as God shall order,” said the
minister; “and God is merciful! Let me now do the will
which he hath made plain before my sight. For, Hester, I am a
dying man. So let me make haste to take my shame upon me!”</p>
<p>Partly supported by Hester Prynne, and holding one hand of
little Pearl’s, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale turned to the dignified
and venerable rulers; to the holy ministers, who were his
brethren; to the people, whose great heart was thoroughly
appalled, yet overflowing with tearful sympathy, as knowing that
some deep life-matter—which, if full of sin, was full of anguish
and repentance likewise—was now to be laid open to them.
The sun, but little past its meridian, shone down upon the clergyman,
and gave a distinctness to his figure, as he stood out from
all the earth, to put in his plea of guilty at the bar of Eternal
Justice.</p>
<p>“People of New England!” cried he, with a voice that rose
over them, high, solemn, and majestic,—yet had always a tremor
through it, and sometimes a shriek, struggling up out of a
fathomless depth of remorse and woe,—“ye, that have loved
me!—ye, that have deemed me holy!—behold me here, the
one sinner of the world! At last!—at last!—I stand upon the
spot where, seven years since, I should have stood; here, with
this woman, whose arm, more than the little strength wherewith
I have crept hitherward, sustains me, at this dreadful
moment, from grovelling down upon my face! Lo, the scarlet
letter which Hester wears! Ye have all shuddered at it! Wherever<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[310]" id="pgepubid00332"><a id="Page_310" title="[310]"></a></span>
her walk hath been,—wherever, so miserably burdened, she
may have hoped to find repose,—it hath cast a lurid gleam of
awe and horrible repugnance round about her. But there stood
one in the midst of you, at whose brand of sin and infamy ye
have not shuddered!”</p>
<p>It seemed, at this point, as if the minister must leave the
remainder of his secret undisclosed. But he fought back the
bodily weakness,—and, still more, the faintness of heart,—that
was striving for the mastery with him. He threw off all assistance,
and stepped passionately forward a pace before the woman
and the child.</p>
<p>“It was on him!” he continued, with a kind of fierceness;
so determined was he to speak out the whole. “God’s eye
beheld it! The angels were forever pointing at it! The Devil
knew it well, and fretted it continually with the touch of his
burning finger! But he hid it cunningly from men, and walked
among you with the mien of a spirit, mournful, because so pure
in a sinful world!—and sad, because he missed his heavenly
kindred! Now, at the death-hour, he stands up before you!
He bids you look again at Hester’s scarlet letter! He tells
you, that, with all its mysterious horror, it is but the shadow
of what he bears on his own breast, and that even this, his own
red stigma, is no more than the type of what has seared his
inmost heart! Stand any here that question God’s judgment on
a sinner? Behold! Behold a dreadful witness of it!”</p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[311]" id="pgepubid00333"><a id="Page_311" title="[311]"></a></span><a href="9125950922386535487_illu_311.jpg.id-1455007216180613916.wrap-0.html.xhtml" id="id-1455007216180613916" title="linked image"><img alt="Shall we not meet again?" src="9125950922386535487_illu_311_th.jpg" title="Shall we not meet again?" id="img_images_illu_311_th.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With a convulsive motion, he tore away the ministerial band
from before his breast. It was revealed! But it were irreverent<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[312]" id="pgepubid00334"><a id="Page_312" title="[312]"></a></span>
to describe that revelation. For an instant, the gaze of
the horror-stricken multitude was concentred on the ghastly miracle;
while the minister stood, with a flush of triumph in his<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[313]"><a id="Page_313" title="[313]"></a></span>
face, as one who, in the crisis of acutest pain, had won a victory.
Then, down he sank upon the scaffold! Hester partly raised
him, and supported his head against her bosom. Old Roger
Chillingworth knelt down beside him, with a blank, dull countenance,
out of which the life seemed to have departed.</p>
<p>“Thou hast escaped me!” he repeated more than once.
“Thou hast escaped me!”</p>
<p>“May God forgive thee!” said the minister. “Thou, too,
hast deeply sinned!”</p>
<p>He withdrew his dying eyes from the old man, and fixed
them on the woman and the child.</p>
<p>“My little Pearl,” said he, feebly,—and there was a sweet
and gentle smile over his face, as of a spirit sinking into deep
repose; nay, now that the burden was removed, it seemed
almost as if he would be sportive with the child,—“dear little
Pearl, wilt thou kiss me now? Thou wouldst not, yonder, in
the forest! But now thou wilt?”</p>
<p>Pearl kissed his lips. A spell was broken. The great scene
of grief, in which the wild infant bore a part, had developed all
her sympathies; and as her tears fell upon her father’s cheek,
they were the pledge that she would grow up amid human
joy and sorrow, nor forever do battle with the world, but be
a woman in it. Towards her mother, too, Pearl’s errand as a
messenger of anguish was all fulfilled.</p>
<p>“Hester,” said the clergyman, “farewell!”</p>
<p>“Shall we not meet again?” whispered she, bending her face
down close to his. “Shall we not spend our immortal life
together? Surely, surely, we have ransomed one another, with
all this woe! Thou lookest far into eternity, with those bright
dying eyes! Then tell me what thou seest?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[314]" id="pgepubid00335"><a id="Page_314" title="[314]"></a></span>”</p>
<p>“Hush, Hester, hush!” said he, with tremulous solemnity.
“The law we broke!—the sin here so awfully revealed!—let
these alone be in thy thoughts! I fear! I fear! It may be,
that, when we forgot our God,—when we violated our reverence
each for the other’s soul,—it was thenceforth vain to
hope that we could meet hereafter, in an everlasting and pure
reunion. God knows; and He is merciful! He hath proved
his mercy, most of all, in my afflictions. By giving me this
burning torture to bear upon my breast! By sending yonder
dark and terrible old man, to keep the torture always at red-heat!
By bringing me hither, to die this death of triumphant
ignominy before the people! Had either of these agonies been
wanting, I had been lost forever! Praised be his name! His
will be done! Farewell!”</p>
<p>That final word came forth with the minister’s expiring breath.
The multitude, silent till then, broke out in a strange, deep voice
of awe and wonder, which could not as yet find utterance, save
in this murmur that rolled so heavily after the departed spirit.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">fter</span> many days, when time sufficed for the
people to arrange their thoughts in reference
to the foregoing scene, there was more
than one account of what had been witnessed
on the scaffold.</p>
<p>Most of the spectators testified to having
seen, on the breast of the unhappy minister, a <small>SCARLET LETTER</small>—the
very semblance of that worn by Hester Prynne—imprinted
in the flesh. As regarded its origin, there were various explanations,
all of which must necessarily have been conjectural.
Some affirmed that the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, on the very
day when Hester Prynne first wore her ignominious badge,
had begun a course of penance,—which he afterwards, in
so many futile methods, followed out,—by inflicting a hideous
torture on himself. Others contended that the stigma had
not been produced until a long time subsequent, when old
Roger Chillingworth, being a potent necromancer, had caused it
to appear, through the agency of magic and poisonous drugs.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[316]" id="pgepubid00339"><a id="Page_316" title="[316]"></a></span>
Others, again,—and those best able to appreciate the minister’s
peculiar sensibility, and the wonderful operation of his spirit
upon the body,—whispered their belief, that the awful symbol
was the effect of the ever-active tooth of remorse, gnawing from
the inmost heart outwardly, and at last manifesting Heaven’s
dreadful judgment by the visible presence of the letter. The
reader may choose among these theories. We have thrown all
the light we could acquire upon the portent, and would gladly,
now that it has done its office, erase its deep print out of our
own brain; where long meditation has fixed it in very undesirable
distinctness.</p>
<p>It is singular, nevertheless, that certain persons, who were
spectators of the whole scene, and professed never once to have
removed their eyes from the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, denied
that there was any mark whatever on his breast, more than on
a new-born infant’s. Neither, by their report, had his dying
words acknowledged, nor even remotely implied, any, the slightest
connection, on his part, with the guilt for which Hester
Prynne had so long worn the scarlet letter. According to these
highly respectable witnesses, the minister, conscious that he was
dying,—conscious, also, that the reverence of the multitude
placed him already among saints and angels,—had desired,
by yielding up his breath in the arms of that fallen woman, to
express to the world how utterly nugatory is the choicest of
man’s own righteousness. After exhausting life in his efforts
for mankind’s spiritual good, he had made the manner of his
death a parable, in order to impress on his admirers the mighty
and mournful lesson, that, in the view of Infinite Purity, we
are sinners all alike. It was to teach them, that the holiest
among us has but attained so far above his fellows as to discern<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[317]" id="pgepubid00340"><a id="Page_317" title="[317]"></a></span>
more clearly the Mercy which looks down, and repudiate
more utterly the phantom of human merit, which would look
aspiringly upward. Without disputing a truth so momentous,
we must be allowed to consider this version of Mr. Dimmesdale’s
story as only an instance of that stubborn fidelity with
which a man’s friends—and especially a clergyman’s—will sometimes
uphold his character, when proofs, clear as the mid-day
sunshine on the scarlet letter, establish him a false and sin-stained
creature of the dust.</p>
<p>The authority which we have chiefly followed,—a manuscript
of old date, drawn up from the verbal testimony of individuals,
some of whom had known Hester Prynne, while others had
heard the tale from contemporary witnesses,—fully confirms the
view taken in the foregoing pages. Among many morals which
press upon us from the poor minister’s miserable experience, we
put only this into a sentence:—“Be true! Be true! Be true!
Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait
whereby the worst may be inferred!”</p>
<p>Nothing was more remarkable than the change which took
place, almost immediately after Mr. Dimmesdale’s death, in the
appearance and demeanor of the old man known as Roger Chillingworth.
All his strength and energy—all his vital and
intellectual force—seemed at once to desert him; insomuch
that he positively withered up, shrivelled away, and almost
vanished from mortal sight, like an uprooted weed that lies
wilting in the sun. This unhappy man had made the very
principle of his life to consist in the pursuit and systematic
exercise of revenge; and when, by its completest triumph and
consummation, that evil principle was left with no further material
to support it, when, in short, there was no more Devil’s work<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[318]" id="pgepubid00341"><a id="Page_318" title="[318]"></a></span>
on earth for him to do, it only remained for the unhumanized
mortal to betake himself whither his Master would find him
tasks enough, and pay him his wages duly. But, to all these
shadowy beings, so long our near acquaintances,—as well Roger
Chillingworth as his companions,—we would fain be merciful.
It is a curious subject of observation and inquiry, whether
hatred and love be not the same thing at bottom. Each, in
its utmost development, supposes a high degree of intimacy
and heart-knowledge; each renders one individual dependent
for the food of his affections and spiritual life upon another;
each leaves the passionate lover, or the no less passionate
hater, forlorn and desolate by the withdrawal of his subject.
Philosophically considered, therefore, the two passions seem
essentially the same, except that one happens to be seen in a
celestial radiance, and the other in a dusky and lurid glow.
In the spiritual world, the old physician and the minister—mutual
victims as they have been—may, unawares, have found
their earthly stock of hatred and antipathy transmuted into golden
love.</p>
<p>Leaving this discussion apart, we have a matter of business
to communicate to the reader. At old Roger Chillingworth’s
decease, (which took place within the year,) and by his last
will and testament, of which Governor Bellingham and the
Reverend Mr. Wilson were executors, he bequeathed a very
considerable amount of property, both here and in England,
to little Pearl, the daughter of Hester Prynne.</p>
<p>So Pearl—the elf-child,—the demon offspring, as some
people, up to that epoch, persisted in considering her,—became
the richest heiress of her day, in the New World. Not improbably,
this circumstance wrought a very material change in the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[319]" id="pgepubid00342"><a id="Page_319" title="[319]"></a></span>
public estimation; and, had the mother and child remained
here, little Pearl, at a marriageable period of life, might have
mingled her wild blood with the lineage of the devoutest Puritan
among them all. But, in no long time after the physician’s
death, the wearer of the scarlet letter disappeared, and Pearl
along with her. For many years, though a vague report would
now and then find its way across the sea,—like a shapeless
piece of drift-wood tost ashore, with the initials of a name upon
it,—yet no tidings of them unquestionably authentic were
received. The story of the scarlet letter grew into a legend.
Its spell, however, was still potent, and kept the scaffold awful
where the poor minister had died, and likewise the cottage by
the sea-shore, where Hester Prynne had dwelt. Near this latter
spot, one afternoon, some children were at play, when they
beheld a tall woman, in a gray robe, approach the cottage-door.
In all those years it had never once been opened; but
either she unlocked it, or the decaying wood and iron yielded
to her hand, or she glided shadow-like through these impediments,—and,
at all events, went in.</p>
<p>On the threshold she paused,—turned partly round,—for,
perchance, the idea of entering all alone, and all so changed,
the home of so intense a former life, was more dreary and desolate
than even she could bear. But her hesitation was only for
an instant, though long enough to display a scarlet letter on her
breast.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[320]" id="pgepubid00343"><a id="Page_320" title="[320]"></a></span><a href="9125950922386535487_illu_320.jpg.id-2451490797426396606.wrap-0.html.xhtml" id="id-2451490797426396606" title="linked image"><img alt="Hester’s Return" src="9125950922386535487_illu_320_th.jpg" title="Hester’s Return" id="img_images_illu_320_th.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And Hester Prynne had returned, and taken up her long-forsaken
shame! But where was little Pearl? If still alive, she
must now have been in the flush and bloom of early womanhood.
None knew—nor ever learned, with the fulness of perfect
certainty—whether the elf-child had gone thus untimely to
a maiden grave; or whether her wild, rich nature had been
softened and subdued, and made capable of a woman’s gentle
happiness. But, through the remainder of Hester’s life, there
were indications that the recluse of the scarlet letter was the
object of love and interest with some inhabitant of another land.
Letters came, with armorial seals upon them, though of bearings
unknown to English heraldry. In the cottage there were articles
of comfort and luxury such as Hester never cared to use, but
which only wealth could have purchased, and affection have<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[321]" id="pgepubid00344"><a id="Page_321" title="[321]"></a></span>
imagined for her. There were trifles, too, little ornaments,
beautiful tokens of a continual remembrance, that must have
been wrought by delicate fingers, at the impulse of a fond heart.
And, once, Hester was seen embroidering a baby-garment, with
such a lavish richness of golden fancy as would have raised a
public tumult, had any infant, thus apparelled, been shown to
our sober-hued community.</p>
<p>In fine, the gossips of that day believed,—and Mr. Surveyor
Pue, who made investigations a century later, believed,—and
one of his recent successors in office, moreover, faithfully
believes,—that Pearl was not only alive, but married, and
happy, and mindful of her mother, and that she would most
joyfully have entertained that sad and lonely mother at her fireside.</p>
<p>But there was a more real life for Hester Prynne here, in
New England, than in that unknown region where Pearl had
found a home. Here had been her sin; here, her sorrow; and
here was yet to be her penitence. She had returned, therefore,
and resumed,—of her own free will, for not the sternest magistrate
of that iron period would have imposed it,—resumed the
symbol of which we have related so dark a tale. Never afterwards
did it quit her bosom. But, in the lapse of the toilsome,
thoughtful, and self-devoted years that made up Hester’s life,
the scarlet letter ceased to be a stigma which attracted the
world’s scorn and bitterness, and became a type of something
to be sorrowed over, and looked upon with awe, yet with reverence
too. And, as Hester Prynne had no selfish ends, nor lived
in any measure for her own profit and enjoyment, people brought
all their sorrows and perplexities, and besought her counsel, as
one who had herself gone through a mighty trouble. Women,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[322]" id="pgepubid00345"><a id="Page_322" title="[322]"></a></span>
more especially,—in the continually recurring trials of wounded,
wasted, wronged, misplaced, or erring and sinful passion,—or
with the dreary burden of a heart unyielded, because unvalued
and unsought,—came to Hester’s cottage, demanding why they
were so wretched, and what the remedy! Hester comforted and
counselled them as best she might. She assured them, too, of
her firm belief, that, at some brighter period, when the world
should have grown ripe for it, in Heaven’s own time, a new
truth would be revealed, in order to establish the whole relation
between man and woman on a surer ground of mutual happiness.
Earlier in life, Hester had vainly imagined that she
herself might be the destined prophetess, but had long since
recognized the impossibility that any mission of divine and
mysterious truth should be confided to a woman stained with
sin, bowed down with shame, or even burdened with a life-long
sorrow. The angel and apostle of the coming revelation
must be a woman, indeed, but lofty, pure, and beautiful;
and wise, moreover, not through dusky grief, but the
ethereal medium of joy; and showing how sacred love should
make us happy, by the truest test of a life successful to such
an end!</p>
<p>So said Hester Prynne, and glanced her sad eyes downward
at the scarlet letter. And, after many, many years, a new
grave was delved, near an old and sunken one, in that burial-ground
beside which King’s Chapel has since been built. It
was near that old and sunken grave, yet with a space between,
as if the dust of the two sleepers had no right to mingle. Yet
one tombstone served for both. All around, there were monuments
carved with armorial bearings; and on this simple slab
of slate—as the curious investigator may still discern, and<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[323]" id="pgepubid00346"><a id="Page_323" title="[323]"></a></span>
perplex himself with the purport—there appeared the semblance
of an engraved escutcheon. It bore a device, a herald’s wording
of which might serve for a motto and brief description of
our now concluded legend; so sombre is it, and relieved only
by one ever-glowing point of light gloomier than the shadow:—</p>
