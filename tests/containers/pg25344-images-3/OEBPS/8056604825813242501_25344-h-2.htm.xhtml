<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">fter</span> the incident last described, the intercourse
between the clergyman and the physician,
though externally the same, was really
of another character than it had previously
been. The intellect of Roger Chillingworth
had now a sufficiently plain path before it.
It was not, indeed, precisely that which he had laid out for himself
to tread. Calm, gentle, passionless, as he appeared, there
was yet, we fear, a quiet depth of malice, hitherto latent, but
active now, in this unfortunate old man, which led him to imagine
a more intimate revenge than any mortal had ever wreaked upon
an enemy. To make himself the one trusted friend, to whom
should be confided all the fear, the remorse, the agony, the ineffectual
repentance, the backward rush of sinful thoughts, expelled
in vain! All that guilty sorrow, hidden from the world, whose
great heart would have pitied and forgiven, to be revealed to him,
the Pitiless, to him, the Unforgiving! All that dark treasure
to be lavished on the very man, to whom nothing else could so
adequately pay the debt of vengeance!<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[169]"><a id="Page_169" title="[169]"></a></span></p>
<p>The clergyman’s shy and sensitive reserve had balked this
scheme. Roger Chillingworth, however, was inclined to be
hardly, if at all, less satisfied with the aspect of affairs, which
Providence—using the avenger and his victim for its own purposes,
and, perchance, pardoning where it seemed most to punish—had
substituted for his black devices. A revelation, he could
almost say, had been granted to him. It mattered little, for his
object, whether celestial, or from what other region. By its aid,
in all the subsequent relations betwixt him and Mr. Dimmesdale,
not merely the external presence, but the very inmost soul, of the
latter, seemed to be brought out before his eyes, so that he
could see and comprehend its every movement. He became,
thenceforth, not a spectator only, but a chief actor, in the poor
minister’s interior world. He could play upon him as he chose.
Would he arouse him with a throb of agony? The victim was
forever on the rack; it needed only to know the spring that controlled
the engine;—and the physician knew it well! Would
he startle him with sudden fear? As at the waving of a magician’s
wand, uprose a grisly phantom,—uprose a thousand phantoms,—in
many shapes, of death, or more awful shame, all
flocking round about the clergyman, and pointing with their
fingers at his breast!</p>
<p>All this was accomplished with a subtlety so perfect, that the
minister, though he had constantly a dim perception of some
evil influence watching over him, could never gain a knowledge
of its actual nature. True, he looked doubtfully, fearfully,—even,
at times, with horror and the bitterness of hatred,—at
the deformed figure of the old physician. His gestures, his gait,
his grizzled beard, his slightest and most indifferent acts, the
very fashion of his garments, were odious in the clergyman’s<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[170]" id="pgepubid00179"><a id="Page_170" title="[170]"></a></span>
sight; a token implicitly to be relied on, of a deeper antipathy
in the breast of the latter than he was willing to acknowledge
to himself. For, as it was impossible to assign a reason for
such distrust and abhorrence, so Mr. Dimmesdale, conscious that
the poison of one morbid spot was infecting his heart’s entire
substance, attributed all his presentiments to no other cause.
He took himself to task for his bad sympathies in reference to
Roger Chillingworth, disregarded the lesson that he should have
drawn from them, and did his best to root them out. Unable
to accomplish this, he nevertheless, as a matter of principle,
continued his habits of social familiarity with the old man, and
thus gave him constant opportunities for perfecting the purpose
to which—poor, forlorn creature that he was, and more wretched
than his victim—the avenger had devoted himself.</p>
<p>While thus suffering under bodily disease, and gnawed and
tortured by some black trouble of the soul, and given over
to the machinations of his deadliest enemy, the Reverend Mr.
Dimmesdale had achieved a brilliant popularity in his sacred
office. He won it, indeed, in great part, by his sorrows. His
intellectual gifts, his moral perceptions, his power of experiencing
and communicating emotion, were kept in a state of
preternatural activity by the prick and anguish of his daily
life. His fame, though still on its upward slope, already overshadowed
the soberer reputations of his fellow-clergymen, eminent
as several of them were. There were scholars among them, who
had spent more years in acquiring abstruse lore, connected with
the divine profession, than Mr. Dimmesdale had lived; and who
might well, therefore, be more profoundly versed in such solid
and valuable attainments than their youthful brother. There
were men, too, of a sturdier texture of mind than his, and<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[171]" id="pgepubid00180"><a id="Page_171" title="[171]"></a></span>
endowed with a far greater share of shrewd, hard, iron, or granite
understanding; which, duly mingled with a fair proportion
of doctrinal ingredient, constitutes a highly respectable, efficacious,
and unamiable variety of the clerical species. There were
others, again, true saintly fathers, whose faculties had been elaborated
by weary toil among their books, and by patient thought,
and etherealized, moreover, by spiritual communications with the
better world, into which their purity of life had almost introduced
these holy personages, with their garments of mortality
still clinging to them. All that they lacked was the gift that
descended upon the chosen disciples at Pentecost, in tongues
of flame; symbolizing, it would seem, not the power of speech
in foreign and unknown languages, but that of addressing the
whole human brotherhood in the heart’s native language. These
fathers, otherwise so apostolic, lacked Heaven’s last and rarest
attestation of their office, the Tongue of Flame. They would
have vainly sought—had they ever dreamed of seeking—to
express the highest truths through the humblest medium of
familiar words and images. Their voices came down, afar and<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[172]"><a id="Page_172" title="[172]"></a></span>
indistinctly, from the upper heights where they habitually dwelt.</p>
<div class="backleft" style="background-image: url(file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/25344/25344-h/images/illu_172.jpg); height: 100%;" id="id-5494843802738796348">
<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:280px; height:150px;"> </div>
<div class="sandbag-left" style="width:355px; height:250px;"> </div>
<p>Not improbably, it was to this latter class of men that Mr.
Dimmesdale, by many of his traits of character, naturally belonged.
To the high mountain-peaks of faith and sanctity he would have
climbed, had not the tendency been thwarted by the burden,
whatever it might be, of crime or anguish, beneath which it was
his doom to totter. It kept him down, on a level with the lowest;
him, the man of ethereal attributes, whose voice the angels
might else have listened to and answered! But this very burden
it was, that gave him sympathies so intimate with the sinful
brotherhood of mankind; so that his heart vibrated in unison
with theirs, and received their pain into itself, and sent its own
throb of pain through a thousand other hearts, in gushes of
sad, persuasive eloquence. Oftenest persuasive, but sometimes
terrible! The people knew not the power that moved them
thus. They deemed the young clergyman a miracle of holiness.
They fancied him the mouthpiece of Heaven’s messages of wisdom,
and rebuke, and love. In their eyes, the very ground on
which he trod was sanctified.
The virgins of
his church grew pale
around him, victims of
a passion so imbued with
religious sentiment that
they imagined it to be
all religion,
and brought
it openly, in
their white
bosoms, as
their most
acceptable
sacrifice before
the altar.
The aged
members of
his flock, beholding
Mr. Dimmesdale’s frame so feeble, while they were themselves
so rugged in their infirmity, believed that he would go
heavenward before them, and enjoined it upon their children,
that their old bones should be buried close to their young pastor’s<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[173]" id="pgepubid00181"><a id="Page_173" title="[173]"></a></span>
holy grave. And, all this time, perchance, when poor Mr.
Dimmesdale was thinking of his grave, he questioned with himself
whether the grass would ever grow on it, because an accursed
thing must there be buried!</p>
</div>
<p>It is inconceivable, the agony with which this public veneration
tortured him! It was his genuine impulse to adore the
truth, and to reckon all things shadow-like, and utterly devoid
of weight or value, that had not its divine essence as the life
within their life. Then, what was he?—a substance?—or the
dimmest of all shadows? He longed to speak out, from his
own pulpit, at the full height of his voice, and tell the people
what he was. “I, whom you behold in these black garments
of the priesthood,—I, who ascend the sacred desk, and turn
my pale face heavenward, taking upon myself to hold communion,
in your behalf, with the Most High Omniscience,—I, in
whose daily life you discern the sanctity of Enoch,—I, whose
footsteps, as you suppose, leave a gleam along my earthly track,
whereby the pilgrims that shall come after me may be guided
to the regions of the blest,—I, who have laid the hand of
baptism upon your children,—I, who have breathed the parting
prayer over your dying friends, to whom the Amen sounded
faintly from a world which they had quitted,—I, your pastor,
whom you so reverence and trust, am utterly a pollution and
a lie!”</p>
<p>More than once, Mr. Dimmesdale had gone into the pulpit,
with a purpose never to come down its steps, until he should
have spoken words like the above. More than once, he had
cleared his throat, and drawn in the long, deep, and tremulous
breath, which, when sent forth again, would come burdened
with the black secret of his soul. More than once—nay, more<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[174]" id="pgepubid00182"><a id="Page_174" title="[174]"></a></span>
than a hundred times—he had actually spoken! Spoken!
But how? He had told his hearers that he was altogether vile,
a viler companion of the vilest, the worst of sinners, an abomination,
a thing of unimaginable iniquity; and that the only
wonder was, that they did not see his wretched body shrivelled
up before their eyes, by the burning wrath of the Almighty!
Could there be plainer speech than this? Would not the people
start up in their seats, by a simultaneous impulse, and tear him
down out of the pulpit which he defiled? Not so, indeed!
They heard it all, and did but reverence him the more. They
little guessed what deadly purport lurked in those self-condemning
words. “The godly youth!” said they among themselves.
“The saint on earth! Alas, if he discern such sinfulness in his
own white soul, what horrid spectacle would he behold in thine
or mine!” The minister well knew—subtle, but remorseful
hypocrite that he was!—the light in which his vague confession
would be viewed. He had striven to put a cheat upon
himself by making the avowal of a guilty conscience, but had
gained only one other sin, and a self-acknowledged shame, without
the momentary relief of being self-deceived. He had spoken
the very truth, and transformed it into the veriest falsehood.
And yet, by the constitution of his nature, he loved the truth,
and loathed the lie, as few men ever did. Therefore, above all
things else, he loathed his miserable self!</p>
<p>His inward trouble drove him to practices more in accordance
with the old, corrupted faith of Rome, than with the better
light of the church in which he had been born and bred. In
Mr. Dimmesdale’s secret closet, under lock and key, there was
a bloody scourge. Oftentimes, this Protestant and Puritan divine
had plied it on his own shoulders; laughing bitterly at himself<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[175]" id="pgepubid00183"><a id="Page_175" title="[175]"></a></span>
the while, and smiting so much the more pitilessly because of
that bitter laugh. It was his custom, too, as it has been that
of many other pious Puritans, to fast,—not, however, like
them, in order to purify the body and render it the fitter
medium of celestial illumination, but rigorously, and until his
knees trembled beneath him, as an act of penance. He kept
vigils, likewise, night after night, sometimes in utter darkness;
sometimes with a glimmering lamp; and sometimes, viewing
his own face in a looking-glass, by the most powerful light
which he could throw upon it. He thus typified the constant
introspection wherewith he tortured, but could not purify, himself.
In these lengthened vigils, his brain often reeled, and
visions seemed to flit before him; perhaps seen doubtfully,
and by a faint light of their own, in the remote dimness of
the chamber, or more vividly, and close beside him, within
the looking-glass. Now it was a herd of diabolic shapes, that
grinned and mocked at the pale minister, and beckoned him
away with them; now a group of shining angels, who flew
upward heavily, as sorrow-laden, but grew more ethereal as they
rose. Now came the dead friends of his youth, and his white-bearded
father, with a saint-like frown, and his mother, turning
her face away as she passed by. Ghost of a mother,—thinnest
fantasy of a mother,—methinks she might yet have thrown a
pitying glance towards her son! And now, through the chamber
which these spectral thoughts had made so ghastly, glided Hester
Prynne, leading along little Pearl, in her scarlet garb, and
pointing her forefinger, first at the scarlet letter on her bosom,
and then at the clergyman’s own breast.</p>
<p>None of these visions ever quite deluded him. At any moment,
by an effort of his will, he could discern substances through their<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[176]" id="pgepubid00184"><a id="Page_176" title="[176]"></a></span>
misty lack of substance, and convince himself that they were not
solid in their nature, like yonder table of carved oak, or that big,
square, leathern-bound and brazen-clasped volume of divinity.
But, for all that, they were, in one sense, the truest and most
substantial things which the poor minister now dealt with. It
is the unspeakable misery of a life so false as his, that it steals
the pith and substance out of whatever realities there are around
us, and which were meant by Heaven to be the spirit’s joy and
nutriment. To the untrue man, the whole universe is false,—it
is impalpable,—it shrinks to nothing within his grasp. And he
himself, in so far as he shows himself in a false light, becomes
a shadow, or, indeed, ceases to exist. The only truth that continued
to give Mr. Dimmesdale a real existence on this earth,
was the anguish in his inmost soul, and the undissembled expression
of it in his aspect. Had he once found power to smile,
and wear a face of gayety, there would have been no such
man!</p>
<p>On one of those ugly nights, which we have faintly hinted at,
but forborne to picture forth, the minister started from his chair.
A new thought had struck him. There might be a moment’s
peace in it. Attiring himself with as much care as if it had
been for public worship, and precisely in the same manner, he
stole softly down the staircase, undid the door, and issued forth.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00187">THE MINISTER’S VIGIL.</h4>
<div class="initial">
<img alt="W" src="9125950922386535487_initial_w.jpg" title="W" id="img_images_initial_w.jpg"/></div>
<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">alking</span> in the shadow of a dream, as it
were, and perhaps actually under the influence
of a species of somnambulism, Mr.
Dimmesdale reached the spot where, now
so long since, Hester Prynne had lived
through her first hours of public ignominy.
The same platform or scaffold, black and weather-stained with
the storm or sunshine of seven long years, and foot-worn, too,
with the tread of many culprits who had since ascended it,
remained standing beneath the balcony of the meeting-house.
The minister went up the steps.</p>
<p>It was an obscure night of early May. An unvaried pall of
cloud muffled the whole expanse of sky from zenith to horizon.
If the same multitude which had stood as eye-witnesses while
Hester Prynne sustained her punishment could now have been
summoned forth, they would have discerned no face above the
platform, nor hardly the outline of a human shape, in the dark
gray of the midnight. But the town was all asleep. There
was no peril of discovery. The minister might stand there, if<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[178]" id="pgepubid00188"><a id="Page_178" title="[178]"></a></span>
it so pleased him, until morning should redden in the east,
without other risk than that the dank and chill night-air would
creep into his frame, and stiffen his joints with rheumatism, and
clog his throat with catarrh and cough; thereby defrauding
the expectant audience of to-morrow’s prayer and sermon. No
eye could see him, save that ever-wakeful one which had seen
him in his closet, wielding the bloody scourge. Why, then,
had he come hither? Was it but the mockery of penitence?
A mockery, indeed, but in which his soul trifled with itself! A
mockery at which angels blushed and wept, while fiends rejoiced,
with jeering laughter! He had been driven hither by the
impulse of that Remorse which dogged him everywhere, and
whose own sister and closely linked companion was that
Cowardice which invariably drew him back, with her tremulous
gripe, just when the other impulse had hurried him to the verge
of a disclosure. Poor, miserable man! what right had infirmity
like his to burden itself with crime? Crime is for the iron-nerved,
who have their choice either to endure it, or, if it press
too hard, to exert their fierce and savage strength for a good
purpose, and fling it off at once! This feeble and most sensitive
of spirits could do neither, yet continually did one thing
or another, which intertwined, in the same inextricable knot, the
agony of heaven-defying guilt and vain repentance.</p>
<p>And thus, while standing on the scaffold, in this vain show
of expiation, Mr. Dimmesdale was overcome with a great horror
of mind, as if the universe were gazing at a scarlet token on
his naked breast, right over his heart. On that spot, in very
truth, there was, and there had long been, the gnawing and
poisonous tooth of bodily pain. Without any effort of his will,
or power to restrain himself, he shrieked aloud; an outcry that<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[179]" id="pgepubid00189"><a id="Page_179" title="[179]"></a></span>
went pealing through the night, and was beaten back from one
house to another, and reverberated from the hills in the background;
as if a company of devils, detecting so much misery
and terror in it, had made a plaything of the sound, and were
bandying it to and fro.</p>
<p>“It is done!” muttered the minister, covering his face with
his hands. “The whole town will awake, and hurry forth, and
find me here!”</p>
<p>But it was not so. The shriek had perhaps sounded with a
far greater power, to his own startled ears, than it actually
possessed. The town did not awake; or, if it did, the drowsy
slumberers mistook the cry either for something frightful in a
dream, or for the noise of witches; whose voices, at that period,
were often heard to pass over the settlements or lonely cottages,
as they rode with Satan through the air. The clergyman, therefore,
hearing no symptoms of disturbance, uncovered his eyes
and looked about him. At one of the chamber-windows of
Governor Bellingham’s mansion, which stood at some distance,
on the line of another street, he beheld the appearance of the
old magistrate himself, with a lamp in his hand, a white night-cap
on his head, and a long white gown enveloping his figure.
He looked like a ghost, evoked unseasonably from the grave.
The cry had evidently startled him. At another window of the
same house, moreover, appeared old Mistress Hibbins, the Governor’s
sister, also with a lamp, which, even thus far off,
revealed the expression of her sour and discontented face. She
thrust forth her head from the lattice, and looked anxiously
upward. Beyond the shadow of a doubt, this venerable witch-lady
had heard Mr. Dimmesdale’s outcry, and interpreted it,
with its multitudinous echoes and reverberations, as the clamor<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[180]" id="pgepubid00190"><a id="Page_180" title="[180]"></a></span>
of the fiends and night-hags, with whom she was well known to
make excursions into the forest.</p>
<p>Detecting the gleam of Governor Bellingham’s lamp, the old
lady quickly extinguished her own, and vanished. Possibly, she
went up among the clouds. The minister saw nothing further
of her motions. The magistrate, after a wary observation of the
darkness,—into which, nevertheless, he could see but little further
than he might into a mill-stone,—retired from the window.</p>
<p>The minister grew comparatively calm. His eyes, however,
were soon greeted by a little, glimmering light, which, at first
a long way off, was approaching up the street. It threw a
gleam of recognition on here a post, and there a garden-fence,
and here a latticed window-pane, and there a pump, with its
full trough of water, and here, again, an arched door of oak,
with an iron knocker, and a rough log for the doorstep. The
Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale noted all these minute particulars,
even while firmly convinced that the doom of his existence was
stealing onward, in the footsteps which he now heard; and that
the gleam of the lantern would fall upon him, in a few moments
more, and reveal his long-hidden secret. As the light drew
nearer, he beheld, within its illuminated circle, his brother clergyman,—or,
to speak more accurately, his professional father, as
well as highly valued friend,—the Reverend Mr. Wilson; who,
as Mr. Dimmesdale now conjectured, had been praying at the
bedside of some dying man. And so he had. The good old
minister came freshly from the death-chamber of Governor
Winthrop, who had passed from earth to heaven within that
very hour. And now, surrounded, like the saint-like personages
of olden times, with a radiant halo, that glorified him amid
this gloomy night of sin,—as if the departed Governor had<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[181]" id="pgepubid00191"><a id="Page_181" title="[181]"></a></span>
left him an inheritance of his glory, or as if he had caught
upon himself the distant shine of the celestial city, while looking
thitherward to see the triumphant pilgrim pass within its
gates,—now, in short, good Father Wilson was moving homeward,
aiding his footsteps with a lighted lantern! The glimmer
of this luminary suggested the above conceits to Mr. Dimmesdale,
who smiled,—nay, almost laughed at them,—and then
wondered if he were going mad.</p>
<p>As the Reverend Mr. Wilson passed beside the scaffold, closely
muffling his Geneva cloak about him with one arm, and holding
the lantern before his breast with the other, the minister could
hardly restrain himself from speaking.</p>
<p>“A good evening to you, venerable Father Wilson! Come
up hither, I pray you, and pass a pleasant hour with me!”</p>
<p>Good heavens! Had Mr. Dimmesdale actually spoken? For
one instant, he believed that these words had passed his lips.
But they were uttered only within his imagination. The venerable
Father Wilson continued to step slowly onward, looking carefully
at the muddy pathway before his feet, and never once turning
his head towards the guilty platform. When the light of the glimmering
lantern had faded quite away, the minister discovered, by
the faintness which came over him, that the last few moments had
been a crisis of terrible anxiety; although his mind had made an
involuntary effort to relieve itself by a kind of lurid playfulness.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, the like grisly sense of the humorous again
stole in among the solemn phantoms of his thought. He felt
his limbs growing stiff with the unaccustomed chilliness of the
night, and doubted whether he should be able to descend the
steps of the scaffold. Morning would break, and find him there.
The neighborhood would begin to rouse itself. The earliest<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[182]" id="pgepubid00192"><a id="Page_182" title="[182]"></a></span>
riser, coming forth in the dim twilight, would perceive a vaguely
defined figure aloft on the place of shame; and, half crazed
betwixt alarm and curiosity, would go, knocking from door to
door, summoning all the people to behold the ghost—as he
needs must think it—of some defunct transgressor. A dusky
tumult would flap its wings from one house to another. Then—the
morning light still waxing stronger—old patriarchs would
rise up in great haste, each in his flannel gown, and matronly
dames, without pausing to put off their night-gear. The whole
tribe of decorous personages, who had never heretofore been seen
with a single hair of their heads awry, would start into public
view, with the disorder of a nightmare in their aspects. Old
Governor Bellingham would come grimly forth, with his King
James’s ruff fastened askew; and Mistress Hibbins, with some
twigs of the forest clinging to her skirts, and looking sourer
than ever, as having hardly got a wink of sleep after her night
ride; and good Father Wilson, too, after spending half the
night at a death-bed, and liking ill to be disturbed, thus early,
out of his dreams about the glorified saints. Hither, likewise,
would come the elders and deacons of Mr. Dimmesdale’s church,
and the young virgins who so idolized their minister, and had
made a shrine for him in their white bosoms; which now, by
the by, in their hurry and confusion, they would scantly have
given themselves time to cover with their kerchiefs. All people,
in a word, would come stumbling over their thresholds, and
turning up their amazed and horror-stricken visages around the
scaffold. Whom would they discern there, with the red eastern
light upon his brow? Whom, but the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale,
half frozen to death, overwhelmed with shame, and standing
where Hester Prynne had stood!<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[183]"><a id="Page_183" title="[183]"></a></span></p>
<p>Carried away by the grotesque horror of this picture, the minister,
unawares, and to his own infinite alarm, burst into a great
peal of laughter. It was immediately responded to by a light,
airy, childish laugh, in which, with a thrill of the heart,—but
he knew not whether of exquisite pain, or pleasure as acute,—he
recognized the tones of little Pearl.</p>
<p>“Pearl! Little Pearl!” cried he after a moment’s pause;
then, suppressing his voice,—“Hester! Hester Prynne! Are
you there?”</p>
<p>“Yes; it is Hester Prynne!” she replied, in a tone of surprise;
and the minister heard her footsteps approaching from
the sidewalk, along which she had been passing. “It is I, and
my little Pearl.”</p>
<p>“Whence come you, Hester?” asked the minister. “What
sent you hither?”</p>
<p>“I have been watching at a death-bed,” answered Hester
Prynne;—“at Governor Winthrop’s death-bed, and have taken his
measure for a robe, and am now going homeward to my dwelling.”</p>
<p>“Come up hither, Hester, thou and little Pearl,” said the
Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. “Ye have both been here before,
but I was not with you. Come up hither once again, and we
will stand all three together!”</p>
<p>She silently ascended the steps, and stood on the platform,
holding little Pearl by the hand. The minister felt for the
child’s other hand, and took it. The moment that he did so,
there came what seemed a tumultuous rush of new life, other
life than his own, pouring like a torrent into his heart, and
hurrying through all his veins, as if the mother and the child
were communicating their vital warmth to his half-torpid system.
The three formed an electric chain.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[184]" id="pgepubid00193"><a id="Page_184" title="[184]"></a></span></p>
<p>“Minister!” whispered little Pearl.</p>
<p>“What wouldst thou say, child?” asked Mr. Dimmesdale.</p>
<p>“Wilt thou stand here with mother and me, to-morrow noontide?”
inquired Pearl.</p>
<p>“Nay; not so, my little Pearl,” answered the minister; for,
with the new energy of the moment, all the dread of public exposure,
that had so long been the anguish of his life, had returned
upon him; and he was already trembling at the conjunction
in which—with a strange joy, nevertheless—he now found
himself. “Not so, my child. I shall, indeed, stand with thy
mother and thee one other day, but not to-morrow.”</p>
<p>Pearl laughed, and attempted to pull away her hand. But
the minister held it fast.</p>
<p>“A moment longer, my child!” said he.</p>
<p>“But wilt thou promise,” asked Pearl, “to take my hand,
and mother’s hand, to-morrow noontide?”</p>
<p>“Not then, Pearl,” said the minister, “but another time.”</p>
<p>“And what other time?” persisted the child.</p>
<p>“At the great judgment day,” whispered the minister,—and,
strangely enough, the sense that he was a professional teacher
of the truth impelled him to answer the child so. “Then, and
there, before the judgment-seat, thy mother, and thou, and I
must stand together. But the daylight of this world shall not
see our meeting!”</p>
<p>Pearl laughed again.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[185]" id="pgepubid00194"><a id="Page_185" title="[185]"></a></span><a href="9125950922386535487_illu_185.jpg.id-3287918283670403716.wrap-0.html.xhtml" id="id-3287918283670403716" title="linked image"><img alt="They stood in the noon of that strange splendor" src="9125950922386535487_illu_185_th.jpg" title="They stood in the noon of that strange splendor" id="img_images_illu_185_th.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>But, before Mr. Dimmesdale had done speaking, a light gleamed
far and wide over all the muffled sky. It was doubtless caused<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[186]" id="pgepubid00195"><a id="Page_186" title="[186]"></a></span>
by one of those meteors, which the night-watcher may so often
observe burning out to waste, in the vacant regions of the atmosphere.
So powerful was its radiance, that it thoroughly illuminated<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[187]"><a id="Page_187" title="[187]"></a></span>
the dense medium of cloud betwixt the sky and earth.
The great vault brightened, like the dome of an immense lamp.
It showed the familiar scene of the street, with the distinctness
of mid-day, but also with the awfulness that is always imparted
to familiar objects by an unaccustomed light. The wooden
houses, with their jutting stories and quaint gable-peaks; the
doorsteps and thresholds, with the early grass springing up
about them; the garden-plots, black with freshly turned earth;
the wheel-track, little worn, and, even in the market-place, margined
with green on either side;—all were visible, but with
a singularity of aspect that seemed to give another moral interpretation
to the things of this world than they had ever borne
before. And there stood the minister, with his hand over his
heart; and Hester Prynne, with the embroidered letter glimmering
on her bosom; and little Pearl, herself a symbol, and
the connecting link between those two. They stood in the noon
of that strange and solemn splendor, as if it were the light that
is to reveal all secrets, and the daybreak that shall unite all
who belong to one another.</p>
<p>There was witchcraft in little Pearl’s eyes, and her face, as
she glanced upward at the minister, wore that naughty smile
which made its expression frequently so elvish. She withdrew
her hand from Mr. Dimmesdale’s, and pointed across the street.
But he clasped both his hands over his breast, and cast his
eyes towards the zenith.</p>
<p>Nothing was more common, in those days, than to interpret
all meteoric appearances, and other natural phenomena, that
occurred with less regularity than the rise and set of sun and
moon, as so many revelations from a supernatural source. Thus,
a blazing spear, a sword of flame, a bow, or a sheaf of arrows,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[188]" id="pgepubid00196"><a id="Page_188" title="[188]"></a></span>
seen in the midnight sky, prefigured Indian warfare. Pestilence
was known to have been foreboded by a shower of crimson
light. We doubt whether any marked event, for good or evil,
ever befell New England, from its settlement down to Revolutionary
times, of which the inhabitants had not been previously
warned by some spectacle of this nature. Not seldom, it had
been seen by multitudes. Oftener, however, its credibility rested
on the faith of some lonely eye-witness, who beheld the wonder
through the colored, magnifying, and distorting medium of his
imagination, and shaped it more distinctly in his after-thought.
It was, indeed, a majestic idea, that the destiny of nations
should be revealed, in these awful hieroglyphics, on the cope of
heaven. A scroll so wide might not be deemed too expansive
for Providence to write a people’s doom upon. The belief was
a favorite one with our forefathers, as betokening that their
infant commonwealth was under a celestial guardianship of peculiar
intimacy and strictness. But what shall we say, when an
individual discovers a revelation addressed to himself alone, on
the same vast sheet of record! In such a case, it could only
be the symptom of a highly disordered mental state, when a
man, rendered morbidly self-contemplative by long, intense, and
secret pain, had extended his egotism over the whole expanse of
nature, until the firmament itself should appear no more than
a fitting page for his soul’s history and fate!</p>
<p>We impute it, therefore, solely to the disease in his own eye
and heart, that the minister, looking upward to the zenith,
beheld there the appearance of an immense letter,—the letter
A,—marked out in lines of dull red light. Not but the
meteor may have shown itself at that point, burning duskily
through a veil of cloud; but with no such shape as his guilty<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[189]" id="pgepubid00197"><a id="Page_189" title="[189]"></a></span>
imagination gave it; or, at least, with so little definiteness, that
another’s guilt might have seen another symbol in it.</p>
<p>There was a singular circumstance that characterized Mr.
Dimmesdale’s psychological state, at this moment. All the time
that he gazed upward to the zenith, he was, nevertheless, perfectly
aware that little Pearl was pointing her finger towards
old Roger Chillingworth, who stood at no great distance from
the scaffold. The minister appeared to see him, with the same
glance that discerned the miraculous letter. To his features, as
to all other objects, the meteoric light imparted a new expression;
or it might well be that the physician was not careful
then, as at all other times, to hide the malevolence with which
he looked upon his victim. Certainly, if the meteor kindled up
the sky, and disclosed the earth, with an awfulness that admonished
Hester Prynne and the clergyman of the day of judgment,
then might Roger Chillingworth have passed with them for the
arch-fiend, standing there with a smile and scowl, to claim his
own. So vivid was the expression, or so intense the minister’s
perception of it, that it seemed still to remain painted on the
darkness, after the meteor had vanished, with an effect as if
the street and all things else were at once annihilated.</p>
<p>“Who is that man, Hester?” gasped Mr. Dimmesdale, overcome
with terror. “I shiver at him! Dost thou know the
man? I hate him, Hester!”</p>
<p>She remembered her oath, and was silent.</p>
<p>“I tell thee, my soul shivers at him!” muttered the minister
again. “Who is he? Who is he? Canst thou do nothing
for me? I have a nameless horror of the man!”</p>
<p>“Minister,” said little Pearl, “I can tell thee who he is!”</p>
<p>“Quickly, then, child!” said the minister, bending his ear<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[190]" id="pgepubid00198"><a id="Page_190" title="[190]"></a></span>
close to her lips. “Quickly!—and as low as thou canst
whisper.”</p>
<p>Pearl mumbled something into his ear, that sounded, indeed,
like human language, but was only such gibberish as children
may be heard amusing themselves with, by the hour together.
At all events, if it involved any secret information in regard to
old Roger Chillingworth, it was in a tongue unknown to the
erudite clergyman, and did but increase the bewilderment of his
mind. The elvish child then laughed aloud.</p>
<p>“Dost thou mock me now?” said the minister.</p>
<p>“Thou wast not bold!—thou wast not true!”—answered
the child. “Thou wouldst not promise to take my hand, and
mother’s hand, to-morrow noontide!”</p>
<p>“Worthy Sir,” answered the physician, who had now advanced
to the foot of the platform. “Pious Master Dimmesdale, can
this be you? Well, well, indeed! We men of study, whose
heads are in our books, have need to be straitly looked after!
We dream in our waking moments, and walk in our sleep.
Come, good Sir, and my dear friend, I pray you, let me lead
you home!”</p>
<p>“How knewest thou that I was here?” asked the minister,
fearfully.</p>
<p>“Verily, and in good faith,” answered Roger Chillingworth,
“I knew nothing of the matter. I had spent the better part
of the night at the bedside of the worshipful Governor Winthrop,
doing what my poor skill might to give him ease. He going
home to a better world, I, likewise, was on my way homeward,
when this strange light shone out. Come with me, I beseech
you, Reverend Sir; else you will be poorly able to do Sabbath
duty to-morrow. Aha! see now, how they trouble the brain,—these<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[191]" id="pgepubid00199"><a id="Page_191" title="[191]"></a></span>
books!—these books! You should study less, good
Sir, and take a little pastime; or these night-whimseys will
grow upon you.”</p>
<p>“I will go home with you,” said Mr. Dimmesdale.</p>
<p>With a chill despondency, like one awaking, all nerveless,
from an ugly dream, he yielded himself to the physician, and
was led away.</p>
<p>The next day, however, being the Sabbath, he preached a
discourse which was held to be the richest and most powerful,
and the most replete with heavenly influences, that had ever
proceeded from his lips. Souls, it is said more souls than one,
were brought to the truth by the efficacy of that sermon, and
vowed within themselves to cherish a holy gratitude towards
Mr. Dimmesdale throughout the long hereafter. But, as he
came down the pulpit steps, the gray-bearded sexton met him,
holding up a black glove, which the minister recognized as his
own.</p>
<p>“It was found,” said the sexton, “this morning, on the
scaffold where evil-doers are set up to public shame. Satan
dropped it there, I take it, intending a scurrilous jest against
your reverence. But, indeed, he was blind and foolish, as he
ever and always is. A pure hand needs no glove to cover it!”</p>
<p>“Thank you, my good friend,” said the minister, gravely,
but startled at heart; for, so confused was his remembrance,
that he had almost brought himself to look at the events of
the past night as visionary. “Yes, it seems to be my glove,
indeed!”</p>
<p>“And since Satan saw fit to steal it, your reverence must
needs handle him without gloves, henceforward,” remarked the
old sexton, grimly smiling. “But did your reverence hear<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[192]" id="pgepubid00200"><a id="Page_192" title="[192]"></a></span>
of the portent that was seen last night?—a great red letter in
the sky,—the letter A, which we interpret to stand for Angel.
For, as our good Governor Winthrop was made an angel this
past night, it was doubtless held fit that there should be some
notice thereof!”</p>
<p>“No,” answered the minister, “I had not heard of it.”</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">n</span> her late singular interview with Mr. Dimmesdale,
Hester Prynne was shocked at the condition
to which she found the clergyman reduced.
His nerve seemed absolutely destroyed. His
moral force was abased into more than childish
weakness. It grovelled helpless on the ground,
even while his intellectual faculties retained their pristine strength,
or had perhaps acquired a morbid energy, which disease only
could have given them. With her knowledge of a train of
circumstances hidden from all others, she could readily infer
that, besides the legitimate action of his own conscience, a
terrible machinery had been brought to bear, and was still
operating, on Mr. Dimmesdale’s well-being and repose. Knowing
what this poor, fallen man had once been, her whole soul
was moved by the shuddering terror with which he had appealed
to her,—the outcast woman,—for support against his instinctively
discovered enemy. She decided, moreover, that he had a
right to her utmost aid. Little accustomed, in her long seclusion<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[194]"><a id="Page_194" title="[194]"></a></span>
from society, to measure her ideas of right and wrong by any
standard external to herself, Hester saw—or seemed to see—that
there lay a responsibility upon her, in reference to the
clergyman, which she owed to no other, nor to the whole world
besides. The links that united her to the rest of human kind—links
of flowers, or silk, or gold, or whatever the material—had
all been broken. Here was the iron link of mutual crime,
which neither he nor she could break. Like all other ties, it
brought along with it its obligations.</p>
<p>Hester Prynne did not now occupy precisely the same position
in which we beheld her during the earlier periods of her
ignominy. Years had come and gone. Pearl was now seven
years old. Her mother, with the scarlet letter on her breast,
glittering in its fantastic embroidery, had long been a familiar
object to the towns-people. As is apt to be the case when a
person stands out in any prominence before the community, and,
at the same time, interferes neither with public nor individual
interests and convenience, a species of general regard had ultimately
grown up in reference to Hester Prynne. It is to the
credit of human nature, that, except where its selfishness is
brought into play, it loves more readily than it hates. Hatred,
by a gradual and quiet process, will even be transformed to love,
unless the change be impeded by a continually new irritation
of the original feeling of hostility. In this matter of Hester
Prynne, there was neither irritation nor irksomeness. She never
battled with the public, but submitted, uncomplainingly, to its
worst usage; she made no claim upon it, in requital for what
she suffered; she did not weigh upon its sympathies. Then,
also, the blameless purity of her life during all these years in
which she had been set apart to infamy, was reckoned largely
in her favor. With nothing now to lose, in the sight of mankind,
and with no hope, and seemingly no wish, of gaining anything,
it could only be a genuine regard for virtue that had
brought back the poor wanderer to its paths.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[195]" id="pgepubid00204"><a id="Page_195" title="[195]"></a></span><a href="9125950922386535487_illu_195.jpg.id-6307485545771194419.wrap-0.html.xhtml" id="id-6307485545771194419" title="linked image"><img alt="Hester in the House of Mourning" src="9125950922386535487_illu_195_th.jpg" title="Hester in the House of Mourning" id="img_images_illu_195_th.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It was perceived, too, that while Hester never put forward
even the humblest title to share in the world’s privileges,—further
than to breathe the common air, and earn daily bread
for little Pearl and herself by the faithful labor of her hands,—she
was quick to acknowledge her sisterhood with the race of
man, whenever benefits were to be conferred. None so ready
as she to give of her little substance to every demand of poverty;
even though the bitter-hearted pauper threw back a gibe
in requital of the food brought regularly to his door, or the
garments wrought for him by the fingers that could have embroidered<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[196]" id="pgepubid00205"><a id="Page_196" title="[196]"></a></span>
a monarch’s robe. None so self-devoted as Hester,
when pestilence stalked through the town. In all seasons of
calamity, indeed, whether general or of individuals, the outcast
of society at once found her place. She came, not as a guest,
but as a rightful inmate, into the household that was darkened
by trouble; as if its gloomy twilight were a medium in which
she was entitled to hold intercourse with her fellow-creatures.
There glimmered the embroidered letter, with comfort in its
unearthly ray. Elsewhere the token of sin, it was the taper
of the sick-chamber. It had even thrown its gleam, in the sufferer’s
hard extremity, across the verge of time. It had shown
him where to set his foot, while the light of earth was fast
becoming dim, and ere the light of futurity could reach him.
In such emergencies, Hester’s nature showed itself warm and
rich; a well-spring of human tenderness, unfailing to every real
demand, and inexhaustible by the largest. Her breast, with its
badge of shame, was but the softer pillow for the head that
needed one. She was self-ordained a Sister of Mercy; or, we
may rather say, the world’s heavy hand had so ordained her,
when neither the world nor she looked forward to this result.
The letter was the symbol of her calling. Such helpfulness was
found in her,—so much power to do, and power to sympathize,—that
many people refused to interpret the scarlet A by
its original signification. They said that it meant Able; so
strong was Hester Prynne, with a woman’s strength.</p>
<p>It was only the darkened house that could contain her. When
sunshine came again, she was not there. Her shadow had faded
across the threshold. The helpful inmate had departed, without
one backward glance to gather up the meed of gratitude, if any
were in the hearts of those whom she had served so zealously.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[197]" id="pgepubid00206"><a id="Page_197" title="[197]"></a></span>
Meeting them in the street, she never raised her head to receive
their greeting. If they were resolute to accost her, she laid her
finger on the scarlet letter, and passed on. This might be pride,
but was so like humility, that it produced all the softening influence
of the latter quality on the public mind. The public is
despotic in its temper; it is capable of denying common justice,
when too strenuously demanded as a right; but quite as frequently
it awards more than justice, when the appeal is made,
as despots love to have it made, entirely to its generosity. Interpreting
Hester Prynne’s deportment as an appeal of this nature,
society was inclined to show its former victim a more benign
countenance than she cared to be favored with, or, perchance,
than she deserved.</p>
<p>The rulers, and the wise and learned men of the community,
were longer in acknowledging the influence of Hester’s good
qualities than the people. The prejudices which they shared in
common with the latter were fortified in themselves by an iron
framework of reasoning, that made it a far tougher labor to
expel them. Day by day, nevertheless, their sour and rigid
wrinkles were relaxing into something which, in the due course
of years, might grow to be an expression of almost benevolence.
Thus it was with the men of rank, on whom their eminent position
imposed the guardianship of the public morals. Individuals
in private life, meanwhile, had quite forgiven Hester Prynne for
her frailty; nay, more, they had begun to look upon the scarlet
letter as the token, not of that one sin, for which she had borne
so long and dreary a penance, but of her many good deeds since.
“Do you see that woman with the embroidered badge?” they
would say to strangers. “It is our Hester,—the town’s own
Hester, who is so kind to the poor, so helpful to the sick, so<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[198]" id="pgepubid00207"><a id="Page_198" title="[198]"></a></span>
comfortable to the afflicted!” Then, it is true, the propensity
of human nature to tell the very worst of itself, when embodied
in the person of another, would constrain them to whisper the
black scandal of bygone years. It was none the less a fact,
however, that, in the eyes of the very men who spoke thus, the
scarlet letter had the effect of the cross on a nun’s bosom. It
imparted to the wearer a kind of sacredness, which enabled her
to walk securely amid all peril. Had she fallen among thieves,
it would have kept her safe. It was reported, and believed by
many, that an Indian had drawn his arrow against the badge,
and that the missile struck it, but fell harmless to the ground.</p>
<p>The effect of the symbol—or, rather, of the position in respect
to society that was indicated by it—on the mind of Hester
Prynne herself, was powerful and peculiar. All the light and
graceful foliage of her character had been withered up by this
red-hot brand, and had long ago fallen away, leaving a bare and
harsh outline, which might have been repulsive, had she possessed
friends or companions to be repelled by it. Even the
attractiveness of her person had undergone a similar change. It
might be partly owing to the studied austerity of her dress, and
partly to the lack of demonstration in her manners. It was
a sad transformation, too, that her rich and luxuriant hair
had either been cut off, or was so completely hidden by a cap,
that not a shining lock of it ever once gushed into the sunshine.
It was due in part to all these causes, but still more
to something else, that there seemed to be no longer anything
in Hester’s face for Love to dwell upon; nothing in Hester’s
form, though majestic and statue-like, that Passion would ever
dream of clasping in its embrace; nothing in Hester’s bosom,
to make it ever again the pillow of Affection. Some attribute<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[199]" id="pgepubid00208"><a id="Page_199" title="[199]"></a></span>
had departed from her, the permanence of which had been essential
to keep her a woman. Such is frequently the fate, and
such the stern development, of the feminine character and person,
when the woman has encountered, and lived through, an
experience of peculiar severity. If she be all tenderness, she
will die. If she survive, the tenderness will either be crushed
out of her, or—and the outward semblance is the same—crushed
so deeply into her heart that it can never show itself
more. The latter is perhaps the truest theory. She who has
once been woman, and ceased to be so, might at any moment
become a woman again if there were only the magic touch to
effect the transfiguration. We shall see whether Hester Prynne
were ever afterwards so touched, and so transfigured.</p>
<p>Much of the marble coldness of Hester’s impression was to
be attributed to the circumstance, that her life had turned, in
a great measure, from passion and feeling, to thought. Standing
alone in the world,—alone, as to any dependence on society,
and with little Pearl to be guided and protected,—alone, and
hopeless of retrieving her position, even had she not scorned to
consider it desirable,—she cast away the fragments of a broken
chain. The world’s law was no law for her mind. It was an
age in which the human intellect, newly emancipated, had taken
a more active and a wider range than for many centuries before.
Men of the sword had overthrown nobles and kings. Men
bolder than these had overthrown and rearranged—not actually,
but within the sphere of theory, which was their most real abode—the
whole system of ancient prejudice, wherewith was linked
much of ancient principle. Hester Prynne imbibed this spirit.
She assumed a freedom of speculation, then common enough on
the other side of the Atlantic, but which our forefathers, had<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[200]" id="pgepubid00209"><a id="Page_200" title="[200]"></a></span>
they known it, would have held to be a deadlier crime than
that stigmatized by the scarlet letter. In her lonesome cottage,
by the sea-shore, thoughts visited her, such as dared to enter no
other dwelling in New England; shadowy guests, that would
have been as perilous as demons to their entertainer, could they
have been seen so much as knocking at her door.</p>
<p>It is remarkable, that persons who speculate the most boldly
often conform with the most perfect quietude to the external
regulations of society. The thought suffices them, without
investing itself in the flesh and blood of action. So it seemed
to be with Hester. Yet, had little Pearl never come to her
from the spiritual world, it might have been far otherwise.
Then, she might have come down to us in history, hand in
hand with Ann Hutchinson, as the foundress of a religious
sect. She might, in one of her phases, have been a prophetess.
She might, and not improbably would, have suffered death
from the stern tribunals of the period, for attempting to undermine
the foundations of the Puritan establishment. But, in the
education of her child, the mother’s enthusiasm of thought had
something to wreak itself upon. Providence, in the person of
this little girl, had assigned to Hester’s charge the germ and
blossom of womanhood, to be cherished and developed amid a
host of difficulties. Everything was against her. The world
was hostile. The child’s own nature had something wrong in
it, which continually betokened that she had been born amiss,—the
effluence of her mother’s lawless passion,—and often impelled
Hester to ask, in bitterness of heart, whether it were for ill
or good that the poor little creature had been born at all.</p>
<p>Indeed, the same dark question often rose into her mind,
with reference to the whole race of womanhood. Was existence<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[201]" id="pgepubid00210"><a id="Page_201" title="[201]"></a></span>
worth accepting, even to the happiest among them? As concerned
her own individual existence, she had long ago decided
in the negative, and dismissed the point as settled. A tendency
to speculation, though it may keep woman quiet, as it does
man, yet makes her sad. She discerns, it may be, such a hopeless
task before her. As a first step, the whole system of society
is to be torn down, and built up anew. Then, the very nature
of the opposite sex, or its long hereditary habit, which has
become like nature, is to be essentially modified, before woman
can be allowed to assume what seems a fair and suitable position.
Finally, all other difficulties being obviated, woman cannot
take advantage of these preliminary reforms, until she herself
shall have undergone a still mightier change; in which, perhaps,
the ethereal essence, wherein she has her truest life, will be
found to have evaporated. A woman never overcomes these
problems by any exercise of thought. They are not to be
solved, or only in one way. If her heart chance to come uppermost,
they vanish. Thus, Hester Prynne, whose heart had lost
its regular and healthy throb, wandered without a clew in the
dark labyrinth of mind; now turned aside by an insurmountable
precipice; now starting back from a deep chasm. There was
wild and ghastly scenery all around her, and a home and comfort
nowhere. At times, a fearful doubt strove to possess her
soul, whether it were not better to send Pearl at once to heaven,
and go herself to such futurity as Eternal Justice should provide.</p>
<p>The scarlet letter had not done its office.</p>
<p>Now, however, her interview with the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale,
on the night of his vigil, had given her a new theme of
reflection, and held up to her an object that appeared worthy
of any exertion and sacrifice for its attainment. She had witnessed<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[202]" id="pgepubid00211"><a id="Page_202" title="[202]"></a></span>
the intense misery beneath which the minister struggled,
or, to speak more accurately, had ceased to struggle. She saw
that he stood on the verge of lunacy, if he had not already
stepped across it. It was impossible to doubt, that, whatever
painful efficacy there might be in the secret sting of remorse, a
deadlier venom had been infused into it by the hand that proffered
relief. A secret enemy had been continually by his side,
under the semblance of a friend and helper, and had availed
himself of the opportunities thus afforded for tampering with the
delicate springs of Mr. Dimmesdale’s nature. Hester could not
but ask herself, whether there had not originally been a defect
of truth, courage, and loyalty, on her own part, in allowing the
minister to be thrown into a position where so much evil was
to be foreboded, and nothing auspicious to be hoped. Her only
justification lay in the fact, that she had been able to discern
no method of rescuing him from a blacker ruin than had overwhelmed
herself, except by acquiescing in Roger Chillingworth’s
scheme of disguise. Under that impulse, she had made her
choice, and had chosen, as it now appeared, the more wretched
alternative of the two. She determined to redeem her error, so
far as it might yet be possible. Strengthened by years of hard
and solemn trial, she felt herself no longer so inadequate to
cope with Roger Chillingworth as on that night, abased by sin,
and half maddened by the ignominy that was still new, when
they had talked together in the prison-chamber. She had climbed
her way, since then, to a higher point. The old man, on the
other hand, had brought himself nearer to her level, or perhaps
below it, by the revenge which he had stooped for.</p>
<p>In fine, Hester Prynne resolved to meet her former husband,
and do what might be in her power for the rescue of the victim<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[203]" id="pgepubid00212"><a id="Page_203" title="[203]"></a></span>
on whom he had so evidently set his gripe. The occasion was
not long to seek. One afternoon, walking with Pearl in a
retired part of the peninsula, she beheld the old physician, with
a basket on one arm, and a staff in the other hand, stooping
along the ground, in quest of roots and herbs to concoct his
medicines withal.</p>

margin of the water, and play with the shells
and tangled sea-weed, until she should have
talked awhile with yonder gatherer of herbs.
So the child flew away like a bird, and,
making bare her small white feet, went pattering
along the moist margin of the sea. Here and there she
came to a full stop, and peeped curiously into a pool, left by
the retiring tide as a mirror for Pearl to see her face in. Forth
peeped at her, out of the pool, with dark, glistening curls around
her head, and an elf-smile in her eyes, the image of a little
maid, whom Pearl, having no other playmate, invited to take
her hand, and run a race with her. But the visionary little
maid, on her part, beckoned likewise, as if to say,—“This is
a better place! Come thou into the pool!” And Pearl, stepping
in, mid-leg deep, beheld her own white feet at the bottom;
while, out of a still lower depth, came the gleam of a kind of
fragmentary smile, floating to and fro in the agitated water.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[205]"><a id="Page_205" title="[205]"></a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, her mother had accosted the physician.</p>
<p>“I would speak a word with you,” said she,—“a word that
concerns us much.”</p>
<p>“Aha! and is it Mistress Hester that has a word for old
Roger Chillingworth?” answered he, raising himself from his
stooping posture. “With all my heart! Why, Mistress, I hear
good tidings of you on all hands! No longer ago than yester-eve,
a magistrate, a wise and godly man, was discoursing of
your affairs, Mistress Hester, and whispered me that there had
been question concerning you in the council. It was debated
whether or no, with safety to the common weal, yonder scarlet
letter might be taken off your bosom. On my life, Hester, I
made my entreaty to the worshipful magistrate that it might
be done forthwith!”</p>
<p>“It lies not in the pleasure of the magistrates to take off
this badge,” calmly replied Hester. “Were I worthy to be
quit of it, it would fall away of its own nature, or be transformed
into something that should speak a different purport.”</p>
<p>“Nay, then, wear it, if it suit you better,” rejoined he. “A
woman must needs follow her own fancy, touching the adornment
of her person. The letter is gayly embroidered, and shows
right bravely on your bosom!”</p>
<p>All this while, Hester had been looking steadily at the old
man, and was shocked, as well as wonder-smitten, to discern
what a change had been wrought upon him within the past
seven years. It was not so much that he had grown older; for
though the traces of advancing life were visible, he bore his age
well, and seemed to retain a wiry vigor and alertness. But
the former aspect of an intellectual and studious man, calm and
quiet, which was what she best remembered in him, had altogether<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[206]" id="pgepubid00216"><a id="Page_206" title="[206]"></a></span>
vanished, and been succeeded by an eager, searching,
almost fierce, yet carefully guarded look. It seemed to be his
wish and purpose to mask this expression with a smile; but
the latter played him false, and flickered over his visage so derisively,
that the spectator could see his blackness all the better
for it. Ever and anon, too, there came a glare of red light out
of his eyes; as if the old man’s soul were on fire, and kept on
smouldering duskily within his breast, until, by some casual
puff of passion, it was blown into a momentary flame. This
he repressed, as speedily as possible, and strove to look as if
nothing of the kind had happened.</p>
<p>In a word, old Roger Chillingworth was a striking evidence
of man’s faculty of transforming himself into a devil, if he will
only, for a reasonable space of time, undertake a devil’s office.
This unhappy person had effected such a transformation, by
devoting himself, for seven years, to the constant analysis of a
heart full of torture, and deriving his enjoyment thence, and
adding fuel to those fiery tortures which he analyzed and gloated
over.</p>
<p>The scarlet letter burned on Hester Prynne’s bosom. Here
was another ruin, the responsibility of which came partly home
to her.</p>
<p>“What see you in my face,” asked the physician, “that you
look at it so earnestly?”</p>
<p>“Something that would make me weep, if there were any
tears bitter enough for it,” answered she. “But let it pass!
It is of yonder miserable man that I would speak.”</p>
<p>“And what of him?” cried Roger Chillingworth, eagerly,
as if he loved the topic, and were glad of an opportunity to
discuss it with the only person of whom he could make a confidant.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[207]" id="pgepubid00217"><a id="Page_207" title="[207]"></a></span>
“Not to hide the truth, Mistress Hester, my thoughts
happen just now to be busy with the gentleman. So speak
freely; and I will make answer.”</p>
<p>“When we last spake together,” said Hester, “now seven
years ago, it was your pleasure to extort a promise of secrecy,
as touching the former relation betwixt yourself and me. As
the life and good fame of yonder man were in your hands,
there seemed no choice to me, save to be silent, in accordance
with your behest. Yet it was not without heavy misgivings
that I thus bound myself; for, having cast off all duty towards
other human beings, there remained a duty towards him; and
something whispered me that I was betraying it, in pledging
myself to keep your counsel. Since that day, no man is so
near to him as you. You tread behind his every footstep. You
are beside him, sleeping and waking. You search his thoughts.
You burrow and rankle in his heart! Your clutch is on his
life, and you cause him to die daily a living death; and still
he knows you not. In permitting this, I have surely acted a
false part by the only man to whom the power was left me to
be true!”</p>
<p>“What choice had you?” asked Roger Chillingworth. “My
finger, pointed at this man, would have hurled him from his
pulpit into a dungeon,—thence, peradventure, to the gallows!”</p>
<p>“It had been better so!” said Hester Prynne.</p>
<p>“What evil have I done the man?” asked Roger Chillingworth
again. “I tell thee, Hester Prynne, the richest fee that
ever physician earned from monarch could not have bought
such care as I have wasted on this miserable priest! But for
my aid, his life would have burned away in torments, within
the first two years after the perpetration of his crime and thine.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[208]" id="pgepubid00218"><a id="Page_208" title="[208]"></a></span>
For, Hester, his spirit lacked the strength that could have borne
up, as thine has, beneath a burden like thy scarlet letter. O,
I could reveal a goodly secret! But enough! What art can
do, I have exhausted on him. That he now breathes, and
creeps about on earth, is owing all to me!”</p>
<p>“Better he had died at once!” said Hester Prynne.</p>
<p>“Yea, woman, thou sayest truly!” cried old Roger Chillingworth,
letting the lurid fire of his heart blaze out before her
eyes. “Better had he died at once! Never did mortal suffer
what this man has suffered. And all, all, in the sight of his
worst enemy! He has been conscious of me. He has felt an
influence dwelling always upon him like a curse. He knew, by
some spiritual sense,—for the Creator never made another
being so sensitive as this,—he knew that no friendly hand was
pulling at his heart-strings, and that an eye was looking curiously
into him, which sought only evil, and found it. But he
knew not that the eye and hand were mine! With the superstition
common to his brotherhood, he fancied himself given
over to a fiend, to be tortured with frightful dreams, and
desperate thoughts, the sting of remorse, and despair of pardon;
as a foretaste of what awaits him beyond the grave. But it
was the constant shadow of my presence!—the closest propinquity
of the man whom he had most vilely wronged!—and
who had grown to exist only by this perpetual poison of the
direst revenge! Yea, indeed!—he did not err!—there was a
fiend at his elbow! A mortal man, with once a human heart,
has become a fiend for his especial torment!”</p>
<p>The unfortunate physician, while uttering these words, lifted
his hands with a look of horror, as if he had beheld some
frightful shape, which he could not recognize, usurping the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[209]" id="pgepubid00219"><a id="Page_209" title="[209]"></a></span>
place of his own image in a glass. It was one of those moments—which
sometimes occur only at the interval of years—when
a man’s moral aspect is faithfully revealed to his mind’s eye.
Not improbably, he had never before viewed himself as he did now.</p>
<p>“Hast thou not tortured him enough?” said Hester, noticing
the old man’s look. “Has he not paid thee all?”</p>
<p>“No!—no!—He has but increased the debt!” answered
the physician; and as he proceeded his manner lost its fiercer
characteristics, and subsided into gloom. “Dost thou remember
me, Hester, as I was nine years agone? Even then, I was in
the autumn of my days, nor was it the early autumn. But all
my life had been made up of earnest, studious, thoughtful, quiet
years, bestowed faithfully for the increase of mine own knowledge,
and faithfully, too, though this latter object was but
casual to the other,—faithfully for the advancement of human
welfare. No life had been more peaceful and innocent than
mine; few lives so rich with benefits conferred. Dost thou
remember me? Was I not, though you might deem me cold,
nevertheless a man thoughtful for others, craving little for himself,—kind,
true, just, and of constant, if not warm affections?
Was I not all this?”</p>
<p>“All this, and more,” said Hester.</p>
<p>“And what am I now?” demanded he, looking into her face,
and permitting the whole evil within him to be written on his
features. “I have already told thee what I am! A fiend! Who
made me so?”</p>
<p>“It was myself!” cried Hester, shuddering. “It was I, not
less than he. Why hast thou not avenged thyself on me?”</p>
<p>“I have left thee to the scarlet letter,” replied Roger Chillingworth.
“If that have not avenged me, I can do no more!<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[210]" id="pgepubid00220"><a id="Page_210" title="[210]"></a></span>”</p>
<p>He laid his finger on it, with a smile.</p>
<p>“It has avenged thee!” answered Hester Prynne.</p>
<p>“I judged no less,” said the physician. “And now, what
wouldst thou with me touching this man?”</p>
<p>“I must reveal the secret,” answered Hester, firmly. “He
must discern thee in thy true character. What may be the
result, I know not. But this long debt of confidence, due from
me to him, whose bane and ruin I have been, shall at length be
paid. So far as concerns the overthrow or preservation of his
fair fame and his earthly state, and perchance his life, he is in
thy hands. Nor do I,—whom the scarlet letter has disciplined
to truth, though it be the truth of red-hot iron, entering into
the soul,—nor do I perceive such advantage in his living any
longer a life of ghastly emptiness, that I shall stoop to implore
thy mercy. Do with him as thou wilt! There is no good for
him,—no good for me,—no good for thee! There is no good
for little Pearl! There is no path to guide us out of this dismal
maze!”</p>
<p>“Woman, I could wellnigh pity thee!” said Roger Chillingworth,
unable to restrain a thrill of admiration too; for there
was a quality almost majestic in the despair which she expressed.
“Thou hadst great elements. Peradventure, hadst thou met
earlier with a better love than mine, this evil had not been. I
pity thee, for the good that has been wasted in thy nature!”</p>
<p>“And I thee,” answered Hester Prynne, “for the hatred that
has transformed a wise and just man to a fiend! Wilt thou
yet purge it out of thee, and be once more human? If not
for his sake, then doubly for thine own! Forgive, and leave
his further retribution to the Power that claims it! I said, but
now, that there could be no good event for him, or thee, or<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[211]" id="pgepubid00221"><a id="Page_211" title="[211]"></a></span>
me, who are here wandering together in this gloomy maze of
evil, and stumbling, at every step, over the guilt wherewith we
have strewn our path. It is not so! There might be good for
thee, and thee alone, since thou hast been deeply wronged, and
hast it at thy will to pardon. Wilt thou give up that only
privilege? Wilt thou reject that priceless benefit?”</p>
<p>“Peace, Hester, peace!” replied the old man, with gloomy
sternness. “It is not granted me to pardon. I have no such
power as thou tellest me of. My old faith, long forgotten,
comes back to me, and explains all that we do, and all we
suffer. By thy first step awry thou didst plant the germ of
evil; but since that moment, it has all been a dark necessity.
Ye that have wronged me are not sinful, save in a kind of
typical illusion; neither am I fiend-like, who have snatched a
fiend’s office from his hands. It is our fate. Let the black
flower blossom as it may! Now go thy ways, and deal as thou
wilt with yonder man.”</p>
<p>He waved his hand, and betook himself again to his employment
of gathering herbs.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">o</span> Roger Chillingworth—a deformed old figure,
with a face that haunted men’s memories
longer than they liked—took leave of Hester
Prynne, and went stooping away along the
earth. He gathered here and there an herb,
or grubbed up a root, and put it into the
basket on his arm. His gray beard almost touched the ground,
as he crept onward. Hester gazed after him a little while, looking
with a half-fantastic curiosity to see whether the tender grass
of early spring would not be blighted beneath him, and show
the wavering track of his footsteps, sere and brown, across its
cheerful verdure. She wondered what sort of herbs they were,
which the old man was so sedulous to gather. Would not the
earth, quickened to an evil purpose by the sympathy of his eye,
greet him with poisonous shrubs, of species hitherto unknown,
that would start up under his fingers? Or might it suffice
him, that every wholesome growth should be converted into
something deleterious and malignant at his touch? Did the
sun, which shone so brightly everywhere else, really fall upon
him? Or was there, as it rather seemed, a circle of ominous
shadow moving along with his deformity, whichever way he
turned himself? And whither was he now going? Would he
not suddenly sink into the earth, leaving a barren and blasted
spot, where, in due course of time, would be seen deadly nightshade,
dogwood, henbane, and whatever else of vegetable wickedness
the climate could produce, all flourishing with hideous
luxuriance? Or would he spread bat’s wings and flee away,
looking so much the uglier, the higher he rose towards heaven?</p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[213]" id="pgepubid00225"><a id="Page_213" title="[213]"></a></span><a href="9125950922386535487_illu_213.jpg.id-8609198519171532455.wrap-0.html.xhtml" id="id-8609198519171532455" title="linked image"><img alt="He gathered herbs here and there" src="9125950922386535487_illu_213_th.jpg" title="He gathered herbs here and there" id="img_images_illu_213_th.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>“Be it sin or no,” said Hester Prynne, bitterly, as she still<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[214]" id="pgepubid00226"><a id="Page_214" title="[214]"></a></span>
gazed after him, “I hate the man!”</p>
<p>She upbraided herself for the sentiment, but could not overcome
or lessen it. Attempting to do so, she thought of those
long-past days, in a distant land, when he used to emerge at
eventide from the seclusion of his study, and sit down in the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[215]" id="pgepubid00227"><a id="Page_215" title="[215]"></a></span>
firelight of their home, and in the light of her nuptial smile.
He needed to bask himself in that smile, he said, in order that
the chill of so many lonely hours among his books might be
taken off the scholar’s heart. Such scenes had once appeared
not otherwise than happy, but now, as viewed through the dismal
medium of her subsequent life, they classed themselves among
her ugliest remembrances. She marvelled how such scenes could
have been! She marvelled how she could ever have been wrought
upon to marry him! She deemed it her crime most to be
repented of, that she had ever endured, and reciprocated, the
lukewarm grasp of his hand, and had suffered the smile of her
lips and eyes to mingle and melt into his own. And it seemed
a fouler offence committed by Roger Chillingworth, than any
which had since been done him, that, in the time when her<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[216]"><a id="Page_216" title="[216]"></a></span>
heart knew no better, he had persuaded her to fancy herself
happy by his side.</p>
<p>“Yes, I hate him!” repeated Hester, more bitterly than
before. “He betrayed me! He has done me worse wrong
than I did him!”</p>
<p>Let men tremble to win the hand of woman, unless they win
along with it the utmost passion of her heart! Else it may be
their miserable fortune, as it was Roger Chillingworth’s, when
some mightier touch than their own may have awakened all her
sensibilities, to be reproached even for the calm content, the
marble image of happiness, which they will have imposed upon
her as the warm reality. But Hester ought long ago to have
done with this injustice. What did it betoken? Had seven
long years, under the torture of the scarlet letter, inflicted so
much of misery, and wrought out no repentance?</p>
<p>The emotions of that brief space, while she stood gazing after
the crooked figure of old Roger Chillingworth, threw a dark
light on Hester’s state of mind, revealing much that she might
not otherwise have acknowledged to herself.</p>
<p>He being gone, she summoned back her child.</p>
<p>“Pearl! Little Pearl! Where are you?”</p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[217]" id="pgepubid00228"><a id="Page_217" title="[217]"></a></span><a href="9125950922386535487_illu_217.jpg.id-4696593669319938936.wrap-0.html.xhtml" id="id-4696593669319938936" title="linked image"><img alt="Pearl on the Sea-shore" src="9125950922386535487_illu_217_th.jpg" title="Pearl on the Sea-shore" id="img_images_illu_217_th.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Pearl, whose activity of spirit never flagged, had been at no
loss for amusement while her mother talked with the old gatherer
of herbs. At first, as already told, she had flirted fancifully
with her own image in a pool of water, beckoning the phantom
forth, and—as it declined to venture—seeking a passage for
herself into its sphere of impalpable earth and unattainable sky.
Soon finding, however, that either she or the image was unreal,
she turned elsewhere for better pastime. She made little boats
out of birch-bark, and freighted them with snail-shells, and sent
out more ventures on the mighty deep than any merchant in
New England; but the larger part of them foundered near the
shore. She seized a live horseshoe by the tail, and made prize
of several five-fingers, and laid out a jelly-fish to melt in the
warm sun. Then she took up the white foam, that streaked
the line of the advancing tide, and threw it upon the breeze,
scampering after it, with winged footsteps, to catch the great
snow-flakes ere they fell. Perceiving a flock of beach-birds,
that fed and fluttered along the shore, the naughty child picked
up her apron full of pebbles, and, creeping from rock to rock
after these small sea-fowl, displayed remarkable dexterity in pelting
them. One little gray bird, with a white breast, Pearl was
almost sure, had been hit by a pebble, and fluttered away with
a broken wing. But then the elf-child sighed, and gave up her<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[218]" id="pgepubid00229"><a id="Page_218" title="[218]"></a></span>
sport; because it grieved her to have done harm to a little being
that was as wild as the sea-breeze, or as wild as Pearl herself.</p>
<p>Her final employment was to gather sea-weed, of various
kinds, and make herself a scarf, or mantle, and a head-dress,
and thus assume the aspect of a little mermaid. She inherited
her mother’s gift for devising drapery and costume. As the last
touch to her mermaid’s garb, Pearl took some eel-grass, and
imitated, as best she could, on her own bosom, the decoration
with which she was so familiar on her mother’s. A letter,—the
letter A,—but freshly green, instead of scarlet! The child
bent her chin upon her breast, and contemplated this device with
strange interest; even as if the one only thing for which she
had been sent into the world was to make out its hidden import.</p>
<p>“I wonder if mother will ask me what it means?” thought
Pearl.</p>
<p>Just then, she heard her mother’s voice, and flitting along as
lightly as one of the little sea-birds, appeared before Hester
Prynne, dancing, laughing, and pointing her finger to the ornament
upon her bosom.</p>
<p>“My little Pearl,” said Hester, after a moment’s silence, “the
green letter, and on thy childish bosom, has no purport. But
dost thou know, my child, what this letter means which thy
mother is doomed to wear?”</p>
<p>“Yes, mother,” said the child. “It is the great letter A.
Thou hast taught me in the horn-book.”</p>
<p>Hester looked steadily into her little face; but, though there
was that singular expression which she had so often remarked
in her black eyes, she could not satisfy herself whether Pearl
really attached any meaning to the symbol. She felt a morbid
desire to ascertain the point.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[219]" id="pgepubid00230"><a id="Page_219" title="[219]"></a></span></p>
<p>“Dost thou know, child, wherefore thy mother wears this
letter?”</p>
<p>“Truly do I!” answered Pearl, looking brightly into her
mother’s face. “It is for the same reason that the minister
keeps his hand over his heart!”</p>
<p>“And what reason is that?” asked Hester, half smiling at
the absurd incongruity of the child’s observation; but, on second
thoughts, turning pale. “What has the letter to do with any
heart, save mine?”</p>
<p>“Nay, mother, I have told all I know,” said Pearl, more
seriously than she was wont to speak. “Ask yonder old man
whom thou hast been talking with! It may be he can tell.
But in good earnest now, mother dear, what does this scarlet
letter mean?—and why dost thou wear it on thy bosom?—and
why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?”</p>
<p>She took her mother’s hand in both her own, and gazed into
her eyes with an earnestness that was seldom seen in her wild
and capricious character. The thought occurred to Hester, that
the child might really be seeking to approach her with childlike
confidence, and doing what she could, and as intelligently as she
knew how, to establish a meeting-point of sympathy. It showed
Pearl in an unwonted aspect. Heretofore, the mother, while
loving her child with the intensity of a sole affection, had schooled
herself to hope for little other return than the waywardness of
an April breeze; which spends its time in airy sport, and has
its gusts of inexplicable passion, and is petulant in its best of
moods, and chills oftener than caresses you, when you take it
to your bosom; in requital of which misdemeanors, it will sometimes,
of its own vague purpose, kiss your cheek with a kind of
doubtful tenderness, and play gently with your hair, and then<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[220]" id="pgepubid00231"><a id="Page_220" title="[220]"></a></span>
be gone about its other idle business, leaving a dreamy pleasure
at your heart. And this, moreover, was a mother’s estimate of
the child’s disposition. Any other observer might have seen
few but unamiable traits, and have given them a far darker
coloring. But now the idea came strongly into Hester’s mind,
that Pearl, with her remarkable precocity and acuteness, might
already have approached the age when she could be made a
friend, and intrusted with as much of her mother’s sorrows as
could be imparted, without irreverence either to the parent or
the child. In the little chaos of Pearl’s character there might
be seen emerging—and could have been, from the very first—the
steadfast principles of an unflinching courage,—an uncontrollable
will,—a sturdy pride, which might be disciplined into
self-respect,—and a bitter scorn of many things, which, when
examined, might be found to have the taint of falsehood in them.
She possessed affections, too, though hitherto acrid and disagreeable,
as are the richest flavors of unripe fruit. With all these
sterling attributes, thought Hester, the evil which she inherited
from her mother must be great indeed, if a noble woman do
not grow out of this elfish child.</p>
<p>Pearl’s inevitable tendency to hover about the enigma of the
scarlet letter seemed an innate quality of her being. From the
earliest epoch of her conscious life, she had entered upon this
as her appointed mission. Hester had often fancied that Providence
had a design of justice and retribution, in endowing the
child with this marked propensity; but never, until now, had
she bethought herself to ask, whether, linked with that design,
there might not likewise be a purpose of mercy and beneficence.
If little Pearl were entertained with faith and trust, as a spirit
messenger no less than an earthly child, might it not be her<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[221]" id="pgepubid00232"><a id="Page_221" title="[221]"></a></span>
errand to soothe away the sorrow that lay cold in her mother’s
heart, and converted it into a tomb?—and to help her to overcome
the passion, once so wild, and even yet neither dead nor
asleep, but only imprisoned within the same tomb-like heart?</p>
<p>Such were some of the thoughts that now stirred in Hester’s
mind, with as much vivacity of impression as if they had actually
been whispered into her ear. And there was little Pearl, all
this while, holding her mother’s hand in both her own, and
turning her face upward, while she put these searching questions,
once, and again, and still a third time.</p>
<p>“What does the letter mean, mother?—and why dost thou
wear it?—and why does the minister keep his hand over his
heart?”</p>
<p>“What shall I say?” thought Hester to herself. “No! If
this be the price of the child’s sympathy, I cannot pay it.”</p>
<p>Then she spoke aloud.</p>
<p>“Silly Pearl,” said she, “what questions are these? There
are many things in this world that a child must not ask about.
What know I of the minister’s heart? And as for the scarlet
letter, I wear it for the sake of its gold-thread.”</p>
<p>In all the seven bygone years, Hester Prynne had never
before been false to the symbol on her bosom. It may be that
it was the talisman of a stern and severe, but yet a guardian
spirit, who now forsook her; as recognizing that, in spite of
his strict watch over her heart, some new evil had crept into
it, or some old one had never been expelled. As for little
Pearl, the earnestness soon passed out of her face.</p>
<p>But the child did not see fit to let the matter drop. Two
or three times, as her mother and she went homeward, and as
often at supper-time, and while Hester was putting her to bed,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[222]" id="pgepubid00233"><a id="Page_222" title="[222]"></a></span>
and once after she seemed to be fairly asleep, Pearl looked up,
with mischief gleaming in her black eyes.</p>
<p>“Mother,” said she, “what does the scarlet letter mean?”</p>
<p>And the next morning, the first indication the child gave of
being awake was by popping up her head from the pillow, and
making that other inquiry, which she had so unaccountably
connected with her investigations about the scarlet letter:—</p>
<p>“Mother!—Mother!—Why does the minister keep his hand
over his heart?”</p>
<p>“Hold thy tongue, naughty child!” answered her mother,
with an asperity that she had never permitted to herself before.
“Do not tease me; else I shall shut thee into the dark
closet!”</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">ester</span> Prynne remained constant in her
resolve to make known to Mr. Dimmesdale,
at whatever risk of present pain or ulterior
consequences, the true character of the man
who had crept into his intimacy. For several
days, however, she vainly sought an opportunity
of addressing him in some of the meditative walks which
she knew him to be in the habit of taking, along the shores of
the peninsula, or on the wooded hills of the neighboring country.
There would have been no scandal, indeed, nor peril to
the holy whiteness of the clergyman’s good fame, had she
visited him in his own study; where many a penitent, ere now,
had confessed sins of perhaps as deep a dye as the one betokened
by the scarlet letter. But, partly that she dreaded the
secret or undisguised interference of old Roger Chillingworth,
and partly that her conscious heart imputed suspicion where
none could have been felt, and partly that both the minister
and she would need the whole wide world to breathe in, while<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[224]"><a id="Page_224" title="[224]"></a></span>
they talked together,—for all these reasons, Hester never thought
of meeting him in any narrower privacy than beneath the open
sky.</p>
<p>At last, while attending in a sick-chamber, whither the Reverend
Mr. Dimmesdale had been summoned to make a prayer, she
learnt that he had gone, the day before, to visit the Apostle
Eliot, among his Indian converts. He would probably return,
by a certain hour, in the afternoon of the morrow. Betimes,
therefore, the next day, Hester took little Pearl,—who was
necessarily the companion of all her mother’s expeditions, however
inconvenient her presence,—and set forth.</p>
<p>The road, after the two wayfarers had crossed from the peninsula
to the mainland, was no other than a footpath. It straggled
onward into the mystery of the primeval forest. This hemmed
it in so narrowly, and stood so black and dense on either side,
and disclosed such imperfect glimpses of the sky above, that,
to Hester’s mind, it imaged not amiss the moral wilderness in
which she had so long been wandering. The day was chill and
sombre. Overhead was a gray expanse of cloud, slightly stirred,
however, by a breeze; so that a gleam of flickering sunshine
might now and then be seen at its solitary play along the path.
This flitting cheerfulness was always at the farther extremity of
some long vista through the forest. The sportive sunlight—feebly
sportive, at best, in the predominant pensiveness of the
day and scene—withdrew itself as they came nigh, and left the
spots where it had danced the drearier, because they had hoped
to find them bright.</p>
<p>“Mother,” said little Pearl, “the sunshine does not love you.
It runs away and hides itself, because it is afraid of something
on your bosom. Now, see! There it is, playing, a good way<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[225]" id="pgepubid00237"><a id="Page_225" title="[225]"></a></span>
off. Stand you here, and let me run and catch it. I am but
a child. It will not flee from me; for I wear nothing on my
bosom yet!”</p>
<p>“Nor ever will, my child, I hope,” said Hester.</p>
<p>“And why not, mother?” asked Pearl, stopping short, just
at the beginning of her race. “Will not it come of its own
accord, when I am a woman grown?”</p>
<p>“Run away, child,” answered her mother, “and catch the
sunshine! It will soon be gone.”</p>
<p>Pearl set forth, at a great pace, and, as Hester smiled to perceive,
did actually catch the sunshine, and stood laughing in the
midst of it, all brightened by its splendor, and scintillating with
the vivacity excited by rapid motion. The light lingered about
the lonely child, as if glad of such a playmate, until her mother
had drawn almost nigh enough to step into the magic circle too.</p>
<p>“It will go now,” said Pearl, shaking her head.</p>
<p>“See!” answered Hester, smiling. “Now I can stretch out
my hand, and grasp some of it.”</p>
<p>As she attempted to do so, the sunshine vanished; or, to
judge from the bright expression that was dancing on Pearl’s
features, her mother could have fancied that the child had
absorbed it into herself, and would give it forth again, with a
gleam about her path, as they should plunge into some gloomier
shade. There was no other attribute that so much impressed
her with a sense of new and untransmitted vigor in Pearl’s
nature, as this never-failing vivacity of spirits; she had not the
disease of sadness, which almost all children, in these latter days,
inherit, with the scrofula, from the troubles of their ancestors.
Perhaps this too was a disease, and but the reflex of the wild
energy with which Hester had fought against her sorrows, before<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[226]" id="pgepubid00238"><a id="Page_226" title="[226]"></a></span>
Pearl’s birth. It was certainly a doubtful charm, imparting a
hard, metallic lustre to the child’s character. She wanted—what
some people want throughout life—a grief that should
deeply touch her, and thus humanize and make her capable of
sympathy. But there was time enough yet for little Pearl.</p>
<p>“Come, my child!” said Hester, looking about her from the
spot where Pearl had stood still in the sunshine. “We will sit
down a little way within the wood, and rest ourselves.”</p>
<p>“I am not aweary, mother,” replied the little girl. “But
you may sit down, if you will tell me a story meanwhile.”</p>
<p>“A story, child!” said Hester. “And about what?”</p>
<p>“O, a story about the Black Man,” answered Pearl, taking
hold of her mother’s gown, and looking up, half earnestly, half
mischievously, into her face. “How he haunts this forest, and
carries a book with him,—a big, heavy book, with iron clasps;
and how this ugly Black Man offers his book and an iron pen
to everybody that meets him here among the trees; and they
are to write their names with their own blood. And then he
sets his mark on their bosoms! Didst thou ever meet the
Black Man, mother?”</p>
<p>“And who told you this story, Pearl?” asked her mother,
recognizing a common superstition of the period.</p>
<p>“It was the old dame in the chimney-corner, at the house
where you watched last night,” said the child. “But she fancied
me asleep while she was talking of it. She said that a thousand
and a thousand people had met him here, and had written in
his book, and have his mark on them. And that ugly-tempered
lady, old Mistress Hibbins, was one. And, mother, the old
dame said that this scarlet letter was the Black Man’s mark on
thee, and that it glows like a red flame when thou meetest him<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[227]" id="pgepubid00239"><a id="Page_227" title="[227]"></a></span>
at midnight, here in the dark wood. Is it true, mother? And
dost thou go to meet him in the night-time?”</p>
<p>“Didst thou ever awake, and find thy mother gone?” asked
Hester.</p>
<p>“Not that I remember,” said the child. “If thou fearest to
leave me in our cottage, thou mightest take me along with thee.
I would very gladly go! But, mother, tell me now! Is there
such a Black Man? And didst thou ever meet him? And is
this his mark?”</p>
<p>“Wilt thou let me be at peace, if I once tell thee?” asked
her mother.</p>
<p>“Yes, if thou tellest me all,” answered Pearl.</p>
<p>“Once in my life I met the Black Man!” said her mother.
“This scarlet letter is his mark!”</p>
<p>Thus conversing, they entered sufficiently deep into the wood
to secure themselves from the observation of any casual passenger
along the forest track. Here they sat down on a luxuriant
heap of moss; which, at some epoch of the preceding
century, had been a gigantic pine, with its roots and trunk in
the darksome shade, and its head aloft in the upper atmosphere.
It was a little dell where they had seated themselves, with a
leaf-strewn bank rising gently on either side, and a brook flowing
through the midst, over a bed of fallen and drowned leaves.
The trees impending over it had flung down great branches,
from time to time, which choked up the current and compelled
it to form eddies and black depths at some points; while, in its
swifter and livelier passages, there appeared a channel-way of
pebbles, and brown, sparkling sand. Letting the eyes follow
along the course of the stream, they could catch the reflected
light from its water, at some short distance within the forest,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[228]" id="pgepubid00240"><a id="Page_228" title="[228]"></a></span>
but soon lost all traces of it amid the bewilderment of tree-trunks
and underbrush, and here and there a huge rock covered
over with gray lichens. All these giant trees and bowlders of
granite seemed intent on making a mystery of the course of this
small brook; fearing, perhaps, that, with its never-ceasing loquacity,
it should whisper tales out of the heart of the old forest
whence it flowed, or mirror its revelations on the smooth surface
of a pool. Continually, indeed, as it stole onward, the streamlet
kept up a babble, kind, quiet, soothing, but melancholy, like
the voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without
playfulness, and knew not how to be merry among sad
acquaintance and events of sombre hue.</p>
<p>“O brook! O foolish and tiresome little brook!” cried
Pearl, after listening awhile to its talk. “Why art thou so
sad? Pluck up a spirit, and do not be all the time sighing
and murmuring!”</p>
<p>But the brook, in the course of its little lifetime among the
forest-trees, had gone through so solemn an experience that it
could not help talking about it, and seemed to have nothing
else to say. Pearl resembled the brook, inasmuch as the current
of her life gushed from a well-spring as mysterious, and
had flowed through scenes shadowed as heavily with gloom.
But, unlike the little stream, she danced and sparkled, and prattled
airily along her course.</p>
<p>“What does this sad little brook say, mother?” inquired she.</p>
<p>“If thou hadst a sorrow of thine own, the brook might tell thee
of it,” answered her mother, “even as it is telling me of mine!
But now, Pearl, I hear a footstep along the path, and the noise of
one putting aside the branches. I would have thee betake thyself
to play, and leave me to speak with him that comes yonder.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[229]" id="pgepubid00241"><a id="Page_229" title="[229]"></a></span>”</p>
<p>“Is it the Black Man?” asked Pearl.</p>
<p>“Wilt thou go and play, child?” repeated her mother.
“But do not stray far into the wood. And take heed that
thou come at my first call.”</p>
<p>“Yes, mother,” answered Pearl. “But if it be the Black
Man, wilt thou not let me stay a moment, and look at him,
with his big book under his arm?”</p>
<p>“Go, silly child!” said her mother, impatiently. “It is no
Black Man! Thou canst see him now, through the trees. It
is the minister!”</p>
<p>“And so it is!” said the child. “And, mother, he has his
hand over his heart! Is it because, when the minister wrote
his name in the book, the Black Man set his mark in that place?
But why does he not wear it outside his bosom, as thou dost,
mother?”</p>
<p>“Go now, child, and thou shalt tease me as thou wilt another
time,” cried Hester Prynne. “But do not stray far. Keep
where thou canst hear the babble of the brook.”</p>
<p>The child went singing away, following up the current of the
brook, and striving to mingle a more lightsome cadence with
its melancholy voice. But the little stream would not be comforted,
and still kept telling its unintelligible secret of some
very mournful mystery that had happened—or making a prophetic
lamentation about something that was yet to happen—within
the verge of the dismal forest. So Pearl, who had enough
of shadow in her own little life, chose to break off all acquaintance
with this repining brook. She set herself, therefore, to
gathering violets and wood-anemones, and some scarlet columbines
that she found growing in the crevices of a high rock.</p>
<p>When her elf-child had departed, Hester Prynne made a step<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[230]" id="pgepubid00242"><a id="Page_230" title="[230]"></a></span>
or two towards the track that led through the forest, but still
remained under the deep shadow of the trees. She beheld the
minister advancing along the path, entirely alone, and leaning
on a staff which he had cut by the wayside. He looked haggard
and feeble, and betrayed a nerveless despondency in his air,
which had never so remarkably characterized him in his walks
about the settlement, nor in any other situation where he deemed
himself liable to notice. Here it was wofully visible, in this
intense seclusion of the forest, which of itself would have been
a heavy trial to the spirits. There was a listlessness in his
gait; as if he saw no reason for taking one step farther, nor
felt any desire to do so, but would have been glad, could he
be glad of anything, to fling himself down at the root of the
nearest tree, and lie there passive, forevermore. The leaves might
bestrew him, and the soil gradually accumulate and form a little
hillock over his frame, no matter whether there were life in
it or no. Death was too definite an object to be wished for,
or avoided.</p>
<p>To Hester’s eye, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale exhibited no
symptom of positive and vivacious suffering, except that, as little
Pearl had remarked, he kept his hand over his heart.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">lowly</span> as the minister walked, he had almost
gone by, before Hester Prynne could gather
voice enough to attract his observation. At
length, she succeeded.</p>
<p>“Arthur Dimmesdale!” she said, faintly
at first; then louder, but hoarsely. “Arthur
Dimmesdale!”</p>
<p>“Who speaks?” answered the minister.</p>
<p>Gathering himself quickly up, he stood more erect, like a man
taken by surprise in a mood to which he was reluctant to have
witnesses. Throwing his eyes anxiously in the direction of the
voice, he indistinctly beheld a form under the trees, clad in
garments so sombre, and so little relieved from the gray twilight
into which the clouded sky and the heavy foliage had darkened
the noontide, that he knew not whether it were a woman or a
shadow. It may be, that his pathway through life was haunted
thus, by a spectre that had stolen out from among his thoughts.</p>
<p>He made a step nigher, and discovered the scarlet letter.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[232]" id="pgepubid00246"><a id="Page_232" title="[232]"></a></span></p>
<p>“Hester! Hester Prynne!” said he. “Is it thou? Art thou
in life?”</p>
<p>“Even so!” she answered. “In such life as has been mine
these seven years past! And thou, Arthur Dimmesdale, dost
thou yet live?”</p>
<p>It was no wonder that they thus questioned one another’s
actual and bodily existence, and even doubted of their own. So
strangely did they meet, in the dim wood, that it was like the
first encounter, in the world beyond the grave, of two spirits
who had been intimately connected in their former life, but now
stood coldly shuddering, in mutual dread; as not yet familiar
with their state, nor wonted to the companionship of disembodied
beings. Each a ghost, and awe-stricken at the other ghost!
They were awe-stricken likewise at themselves; because the crisis
flung back to them their consciousness, and revealed to each
heart its history and experience, as life never does, except at
such breathless epochs. The soul beheld its features in the
mirror of the passing moment. It was with fear, and tremulously,
and, as it were, by a slow, reluctant necessity, that
Arthur Dimmesdale put forth his hand, chill as death, and
touched the chill hand of Hester Prynne. The grasp, cold as
it was, took away what was dreariest in the interview. They
now felt themselves, at least, inhabitants of the same sphere.</p>
<p>Without a word more spoken,—neither he nor she assuming
the guidance, but with an unexpressed consent,—they glided
back into the shadow of the woods, whence Hester had emerged,
and sat down on the heap of moss where she and Pearl had
before been sitting. When they found voice to speak, it was,
at first, only to utter remarks and inquiries such as any two
acquaintance might have made, about the gloomy sky, the threatening<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[233]" id="pgepubid00247"><a id="Page_233" title="[233]"></a></span>
storm, and, next, the health of each. Thus they went
onward, not boldly, but step by step, into the themes that were
brooding deepest in their hearts. So long estranged by fate and
circumstances, they needed something slight and casual to run
before, and throw open the doors of intercourse, so that their
real thoughts might be led across the threshold.</p>
<p>After a while, the minister fixed his eyes on Hester Prynne’s.</p>
<p>“Hester,” said he, “hast thou found peace?”</p>
<p>She smiled drearily, looking down upon her bosom.</p>
<p>“Hast thou?” she asked.</p>
<p>“None!—nothing but despair!” he answered. “What else
could I look for, being what I am, and leading such a life as
mine? Were I an atheist,—a man devoid of conscience,—a
wretch with coarse and brutal instincts,—I might have found
peace, long ere now. Nay, I never should have lost it! But,
as matters stand with my soul, whatever of good capacity there
originally was in me, all of God’s gifts that were the choicest
have become the ministers of spiritual torment. Hester, I am
most miserable!”</p>
<p>“The people reverence thee,” said Hester. “And surely thou
workest good among them! Doth this bring thee no comfort?”</p>
<p>“More misery, Hester!—only the more misery!” answered
the clergyman, with a bitter smile. “As concerns the good which I
may appear to do, I have no faith in it. It must needs be a
delusion. What can a ruined soul, like mine, effect towards the
redemption of other souls?—or a polluted soul towards their
purification? And as for the people’s reverence, would that
it were turned to scorn and hatred! Canst thou deem it,
Hester, a consolation, that I must stand up in my pulpit, and
meet so many eyes turned upward to my face, as if the light<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[234]" id="pgepubid00248"><a id="Page_234" title="[234]"></a></span>
of heaven were beaming from it!—must see my flock hungry
for the truth, and listening to my words as if a tongue of
Pentecost were speaking!—and then look inward, and discern
the black reality of what they idolize? I have laughed, in bitterness
and agony of heart, at the contrast between what I seem
and what I am! And Satan laughs at it!”</p>
<p>“You wrong yourself in this,” said Hester, gently. “You
have deeply and sorely repented. Your sin is left behind you,
in the days long past. Your present life is not less holy, in
very truth, than it seems in people’s eyes. Is there no reality
in the penitence thus sealed and witnessed by good works? And
wherefore should it not bring you peace?”</p>
<p>“No, Hester, no!” replied the clergyman. “There is no
substance in it! It is cold and dead, and can do nothing for
me! Of penance, I have had enough! Of penitence, there has
been none! Else, I should long ago have thrown off these
garments of mock holiness, and have shown myself to mankind
as they will see me at the judgment-seat. Happy are you,
Hester, that wear the scarlet letter openly upon your bosom!
Mine burns in secret! Thou little knowest what a relief it is,
after the torment of a seven years’ cheat, to look into an eye
that recognizes me for what I am! Had I one friend,—or
were it my worst enemy!—to whom, when sickened with the
praises of all other men, I could daily betake myself, and be
known as the vilest of all sinners, methinks my soul might keep
itself alive thereby. Even thus much of truth would save me!
But, now, it is all falsehood!—all emptiness!—all death!”</p>
<p>Hester Prynne looked into his face, but hesitated to speak.
Yet, uttering his long-restrained emotions so vehemently as he
did, his words here offered her the very point of circumstances<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[235]" id="pgepubid00249"><a id="Page_235" title="[235]"></a></span>
in which to interpose what she came to say. She conquered
her fears, and spoke.</p>
<p>“Such a friend as thou hast even now wished for,” said she,
“with whom to weep over thy sin, thou hast in me, the partner
of it!”—Again she hesitated, but brought out the words with
an effort.—“Thou hast long had such an enemy, and dwellest
with him, under the same roof!”</p>
<p>The minister started to his feet, gasping for breath, and clutching
at his heart, as if he would have torn it out of his bosom.</p>
<p>“Ha! What sayest thou!” cried he. “An enemy! And
under mine own roof! What mean you?”</p>
<p>Hester Prynne was now fully sensible of the deep injury for
which she was responsible to this unhappy man, in permitting
him to lie for so many years, or, indeed, for a single moment,
at the mercy of one whose purposes could not be other than
malevolent. The very contiguity of his enemy, beneath whatever
mask the latter might conceal himself, was enough to disturb
the magnetic sphere of a being so sensitive as Arthur
Dimmesdale. There had been a period when Hester was less
alive to this consideration; or, perhaps, in the misanthropy of
her own trouble, she left the minister to bear what she might
picture to herself as a more tolerable doom. But of late, since
the night of his vigil, all her sympathies towards him had been
both softened and invigorated. She now read his heart more
accurately. She doubted not, that the continual presence of Roger
Chillingworth,—the secret poison of his malignity, infecting all
the air about him,—and his authorized interference, as a physician,
with the minister’s physical and spiritual infirmities,—that
these bad opportunities had been turned to a cruel purpose.
By means of them, the sufferer’s conscience had been<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[236]" id="pgepubid00250"><a id="Page_236" title="[236]"></a></span>
kept in an irritated state, the tendency of which was, not to
cure by wholesome pain, but to disorganize and corrupt his
spiritual being. Its result, on earth, could hardly fail to be
insanity, and hereafter, that eternal alienation from the Good
and True, of which madness is perhaps the earthly type.</p>
<p>Such was the ruin to which she had brought the man, once,—nay,
why should we not speak it?—still so passionately loved!
Hester felt that the sacrifice of the clergyman’s good name, and
death itself, as she had already told Roger Chillingworth,
would have been infinitely preferable to the alternative which
she had taken upon herself to choose. And now, rather than have
had this grievous wrong to confess, she would gladly have lain
down on the forest-leaves, and died there, at Arthur Dimmesdale’s
feet.</p>
<p>“O Arthur,” cried she, “forgive me! In all things else,
I have striven to be true! Truth was the one virtue which I
might have held fast, and did hold fast, through all extremity;
save when thy good,—thy life,—thy fame,—were put in question!
Then I consented to a deception. But a lie is never
good, even though death threaten on the other side! Dost thou
not see what I would say? That old man!—the physician!—he
whom they call Roger Chillingworth!—he was my husband!”</p>

<p>The minister looked at her, for an instant, with all that violence
of passion, which—intermixed, in more shapes than one,
with his higher, purer, softer qualities—was, in fact, the portion
of him which the Devil claimed, and through which he sought<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[238]" id="pgepubid00252"><a id="Page_238" title="[238]"></a></span>
to win the rest. Never was there a blacker or a fiercer frown
than Hester now encountered. For the brief space that it lasted,
it was a dark transfiguration. But his character had been so<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[239]"><a id="Page_239" title="[239]"></a></span>
much enfeebled by suffering, that even its lower energies were
incapable of more than a temporary struggle. He sank down
on the ground, and buried his face in his hands.</p>
<p>“I might have known it,” murmured he. “I did know it!
Was not the secret told me, in the natural recoil of my heart,
at the first sight of him, and as often as I have seen him since?
Why did I not understand? O Hester Prynne, thou little,
little knowest all the horror of this thing! And the shame!—the
indelicacy!—the horrible ugliness of this exposure of a sick
and guilty heart to the very eye that would gloat over it!
Woman, woman, thou art accountable for this! I cannot forgive
thee!”</p>
<p>“Thou shalt forgive me!” cried Hester, flinging herself on
the fallen leaves beside him. “Let God punish! Thou shalt
forgive!”</p>
<p>With sudden and desperate tenderness, she threw her arms
around him, and pressed his head against her bosom; little
caring though his cheek rested on the scarlet letter. He would
have released himself, but strove in vain to do so. Hester would
not set him free, lest he should look her sternly in the face.
All the world had frowned on her,—for seven long years had
it frowned upon this lonely woman,—and still she bore it all,
nor ever once turned away her firm, sad eyes. Heaven, likewise,
had frowned upon her, and she had not died. But the frown
of this pale, weak, sinful, and sorrow-stricken man was what
Hester could not bear and live!</p>
<p>“Wilt thou yet forgive me?” she repeated, over and over
again. “Wilt thou not frown? Wilt thou forgive?”</p>
<p>“I do forgive you, Hester,” replied the minister, at length,
with a deep utterance, out of an abyss of sadness, but no anger.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[240]" id="pgepubid00253"><a id="Page_240" title="[240]"></a></span>
“I freely forgive you now. May God forgive us both! We
are not, Hester, the worst sinners in the world. There is one
worse than even the polluted priest! That old man’s revenge has
been blacker than my sin. He has violated, in cold blood, the
sanctity of a human heart. Thou and I, Hester, never did so!”</p>
<p>“Never, never!” whispered she. “What we did had a
consecration of its own. We felt it so! We said so to each
other! Hast thou forgotten it?”</p>
<p>“Hush, Hester!” said Arthur Dimmesdale, rising from the
ground. “No; I have not forgotten!”</p>
<p>They sat down again, side by side, and hand clasped in hand,
on the mossy trunk of the fallen tree. Life had never brought
them a gloomier hour; it was the point whither their pathway
had so long been tending, and darkening ever, as it stole along;—and
yet it enclosed a charm that made them linger upon it,
and claim another, and another, and, after all, another moment.
The forest was obscure around them, and creaked with a blast
that was passing through it. The boughs were tossing heavily
above their heads; while one solemn old tree groaned dolefully
to another, as if telling the sad story of the pair that sat
beneath, or constrained to forebode evil to come.</p>
<p>And yet they lingered. How dreary looked the forest-track
that led backward to the settlement, where Hester Prynne must
take up again the burden of her ignominy, and the minister the
hollow mockery of his good name! So they lingered an instant
longer. No golden light had ever been so precious as the gloom
of this dark forest. Here, seen only by his eyes, the scarlet
letter need not burn into the bosom of the fallen woman!
Here, seen only by her eyes, Arthur Dimmesdale, false to God
and man, might be, for one moment, true!<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[241]" id="pgepubid00254"><a id="Page_241" title="[241]"></a></span></p>
<p>He started at a thought that suddenly occurred to him.</p>
<p>“Hester,” cried he, “here is a new horror! Roger Chillingworth
knows your purpose to reveal his true character. Will
he continue, then, to keep our secret? What will now be the
course of his revenge?”</p>
<p>“There is a strange secrecy in his nature,” replied Hester,
thoughtfully; “and it has grown upon him by the hidden practices
of his revenge. I deem it not likely that he will betray
the secret. He will doubtless seek other means of satiating his
dark passion.”</p>
<p>“And I!—how am I to live longer, breathing the same
air with this deadly enemy?” exclaimed Arthur Dimmesdale,
shrinking within himself, and pressing his hand nervously against
his heart,—a gesture that had grown involuntary with him.</p>
<p>“Think for me, Hester! Thou art strong. Resolve for me!”</p>
<p>“Thou must dwell no longer with this man,” said Hester,
slowly and firmly. “Thy heart must be no longer under his
evil eye!”</p>
<p>“It were far worse than death!” replied the minister. “But
how to avoid it? What choice remains to me? Shall I lie
down again on these withered leaves, where I cast myself when
thou didst tell me what he was? Must I sink down there, and
die at once?”</p>
<p>“Alas, what a ruin has befallen thee!” said Hester, with the
tears gushing into her eyes. “Wilt thou die for very weakness?
There is no other cause!”</p>
<p>“The judgment of God is on me,” answered the conscience-stricken
priest. “It is too mighty for me to struggle with!”</p>
<p>“Heaven would show mercy,” rejoined Hester, “hadst thou
but the strength to take advantage of it.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[242]" id="pgepubid00255"><a id="Page_242" title="[242]"></a></span>”</p>
<p>“Be thou strong for me!” answered he. “Advise me what
to do.”</p>
<p>“Is the world, then, so narrow?” exclaimed Hester Prynne,
fixing her deep eyes on the minister’s, and instinctively exercising
a magnetic power over a spirit so shattered and subdued
that it could hardly hold itself erect. “Doth the universe lie
within the compass of yonder town, which only a little time
ago was but a leaf-strewn desert, as lonely as this around us?
Whither leads yonder forest-track? Backward to the settlement,
thou sayest! Yes; but onward, too. Deeper it goes, and
deeper, into the wilderness, less plainly to be seen at every step;
until, some few miles hence, the yellow leaves will show no
vestige of the white man’s tread. There thou art free! So
brief a journey would bring thee from a world where thou hast
been most wretched, to one where thou mayest still be happy!
Is there not shade enough in all this boundless forest to hide
thy heart from the gaze of Roger Chillingworth?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Hester; but only under the fallen leaves!” replied the
minister, with a sad smile.</p>
<p>“Then there is the broad pathway of the sea!” continued
Hester. “It brought thee hither. If thou so choose, it will
bear thee back again. In our native land, whether in some
remote rural village or in vast London,—or, surely, in Germany,
in France, in pleasant Italy,—thou wouldst be beyond his power
and knowledge! And what hast thou to do with all these iron
men, and their opinions? They have kept thy better part in
bondage too long already!”</p>
<p>“It cannot be!” answered the minister, listening as if he
were called upon to realize a dream. “I am powerless to go!
Wretched and sinful as I am, I have had no other thought<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[243]" id="pgepubid00256"><a id="Page_243" title="[243]"></a></span>
than to drag on my earthly existence in the sphere where Providence
hath placed me. Lost as my own soul is, I would still
do what I may for other human souls! I dare not quit my
post, though an unfaithful sentinel, whose sure reward is death
and dishonor, when his dreary watch shall come to an end!”</p>
<p>“Thou art crushed under this seven years’ weight of misery,”
replied Hester, fervently resolved to buoy him up with her own
energy. “But thou shalt leave it all behind thee! It shall not
cumber thy steps, as thou treadest along the forest-path; neither
shalt thou freight the ship with it, if thou prefer to cross the
sea. Leave this wreck and ruin here where it hath happened.
Meddle no more with it! Begin all anew! Hast thou exhausted
possibility in the failure of this one trial? Not so! The future
is yet full of trial and success. There is happiness to be enjoyed!
There is good to be done! Exchange this false life of thine for
a true one. Be, if thy spirit summon thee to such a mission,
the teacher and apostle of the red men. Or,—as is more thy
nature,—be a scholar and a sage among the wisest and the
most renowned of the cultivated world. Preach! Write! Act!
Do anything, save to lie down and die! Give up this name of
Arthur Dimmesdale, and make thyself another, and a high one,
such as thou canst wear without fear or shame. Why shouldst
thou tarry so much as one other day in the torments that have
so gnawed into thy life!—that have made thee feeble to will
and to do!—that will leave thee powerless even to repent!
Up, and away!”</p>
<p>“O Hester!” cried Arthur Dimmesdale, in whose eyes a fitful
light, kindled by her enthusiasm, flashed up and died away,
“thou tellest of running a race to a man whose knees are tottering
beneath him! I must die here! There is not the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[244]" id="pgepubid00257"><a id="Page_244" title="[244]"></a></span>
strength or courage left me to venture into the wide, strange,
difficult world, alone!”</p>
<p>It was the last expression of the despondency of a broken
spirit. He lacked energy to grasp the better fortune that seemed
within his reach.</p>
<p>He repeated the word.</p>
<p>“Alone, Hester!”</p>
<p>“Thou shalt not go alone!” answered she, in a deep whisper.</p>
<p>Then, all was spoken!</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">rthur</span> Dimmesdale gazed into Hester’s
face with a look in which hope and joy
shone out, indeed, but with fear betwixt
them, and a kind of horror at her boldness,
who had spoken what he vaguely hinted at,
but dared not speak.</p>
<p>But Hester Prynne, with a mind of native courage and activity,
and for so long a period not merely estranged, but outlawed,
from society, had habituated herself to such latitude of speculation
as was altogether foreign to the clergyman. She had wandered,
without rule or guidance, in a moral wilderness; as vast, as intricate
and shadowy, as the untamed forest, amid the gloom of
which they were now holding a colloquy that was to decide
their fate. Her intellect and heart had their home, as it were,
in desert places, where she roamed as freely as the wild Indian
in his woods. For years past she had looked from this estranged
point of view at human institutions, and whatever priests or legislators
had established; criticising all with hardly more reverence<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[246]" id="pgepubid00261"><a id="Page_246" title="[246]"></a></span>
than the Indian would feel for the clerical band, the judicial
robe, the pillory, the gallows, the fireside, or the church. The
tendency of her fate and fortunes had been to set her free. The
scarlet letter was her passport into regions where other women
dared not tread. Shame, Despair, Solitude! These had been
her teachers,—stern and wild ones,—and they had made her
strong, but taught her much amiss.</p>
<p>The minister, on the other hand, had never gone through an
experience calculated to lead him beyond the scope of generally
received laws; although, in a single instance, he had so fearfully
transgressed one of the most sacred of them. But this
had been a sin of passion, not of principle, nor even purpose.
Since that wretched epoch, he had watched, with morbid zeal
and minuteness, not his acts,—for those it was easy to arrange,—but
each breath of emotion, and his every thought. At the
head of the social system, as the clergymen of that day stood,
he was only the more trammelled by its regulations, its principles,
and even its prejudices. As a priest, the framework of
his order inevitably hemmed him in. As a man who had once
sinned, but who kept his conscience all alive and painfully sensitive
by the fretting of an unhealed wound, he might have been
supposed safer within the line of virtue than if he had never
sinned at all.</p>
<p>Thus, we seem to see that, as regarded Hester Prynne, the
whole seven years of outlaw and ignominy had been little other
than a preparation for this very hour. But Arthur Dimmesdale!
Were such a man once more to fall, what plea could
be urged in extenuation of his crime? None; unless it avail
him somewhat, that he was broken down by long and exquisite
suffering; that his mind was darkened and confused by the very<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[247]" id="pgepubid00262"><a id="Page_247" title="[247]"></a></span>
remorse which harrowed it; that, between fleeing as an avowed
criminal, and remaining as a hypocrite, conscience might find
it hard to strike the balance; that it was human to avoid the
peril of death and infamy, and the inscrutable machinations of
an enemy; that, finally, to this poor pilgrim, on his dreary and
desert path, faint, sick, miserable, there appeared a glimpse of
human affection and sympathy, a new life, and a true one, in
exchange for the heavy doom which he was now expiating. And
be the stern and sad truth spoken, that the breach which guilt
has once made into the human soul is never, in this mortal
state, repaired. It may be watched and guarded; so that the
enemy shall not force his way again into the citadel, and might
even, in his subsequent assaults, select some other avenue, in
preference to that where he had formerly succeeded. But there
is still the ruined wall, and, near it, the stealthy tread of the
foe that would win over again his unforgotten triumph.</p>
<p>The struggle, if there were one, need not be described. Let
it suffice, that the clergyman resolved to flee, and not alone.</p>
<p>“If, in all these past seven years,” thought he, “I could
recall one instant of peace or hope, I would yet endure, for the
sake of that earnest of Heaven’s mercy. But now,—since I
am irrevocably doomed,—wherefore should I not snatch the
solace allowed to the condemned culprit before his execution?
Or, if this be the path to a better life, as Hester would persuade
me, I surely give up no fairer prospect by pursuing it!
Neither can I any longer live without her companionship; so
powerful is she to sustain,—so tender to soothe! O Thou to
whom I dare not lift mine eyes, wilt Thou yet pardon me!”</p>
<p>“Thou wilt go!” said Hester, calmly, as he met her glance.</p>
<p>The decision once made, a glow of strange enjoyment threw<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[248]" id="pgepubid00263"><a id="Page_248" title="[248]"></a></span>
its flickering brightness over the trouble of his breast. It was
the exhilarating effect—upon a prisoner just escaped from the
dungeon of his own heart—of breathing the wild, free atmosphere
of an unredeemed, unchristianized, lawless region. His
spirit rose, as it were, with a bound, and attained a nearer prospect
of the sky, than throughout all the misery which had kept
him grovelling on the earth. Of a deeply religious temperament,
there was inevitably a tinge of the devotional in his
mood.</p>
<p>“Do I feel joy again?” cried he, wondering at himself.
“Methought the germ of it was dead in me! O Hester, thou
art my better angel! I seem to have flung myself—sick, sin-stained,
and sorrow-blackened—down upon these forest-leaves,
and to have risen up all made anew, and with new powers to
glorify Him that hath been merciful! This is already the better
life! Why did we not find it sooner?”</p>
<p>“Let us not look back,” answered Hester Prynne. “The
past is gone! Wherefore should we linger upon it now? See!
With this symbol, I undo it all, and make it as it had never
been!”</p>
<p>So speaking, she undid the clasp that fastened the scarlet letter,
and, taking it from her bosom, threw it to a distance among the
withered leaves. The mystic token alighted on the hither verge
of the stream. With a hand’s breadth farther flight it would
have fallen into the water, and have given the little brook
another woe to carry onward, besides the unintelligible tale which
it still kept murmuring about. But there lay the embroidered
letter, glittering like a lost jewel, which some ill-fated wanderer
might pick up, and thenceforth be haunted by strange phantoms
of guilt, sinkings of the heart, and unaccountable misfortune.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[249]" id="pgepubid00264"><a id="Page_249" title="[249]"></a></span><a href="9125950922386535487_illu_249.jpg.id-4093825118370213894.wrap-0.html.xhtml" id="id-4093825118370213894" title="linked image"><img alt="A Gleam of Sunshine" src="9125950922386535487_illu_249_th.jpg" title="A Gleam of Sunshine" id="img_images_illu_249_th.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The stigma gone, Hester heaved a long, deep sigh, in which
the burden of shame and anguish departed from her spirit. O
exquisite relief! She had not known the weight, until she felt
the freedom! By another impulse, she took off the formal cap
that confined her hair; and down it fell upon her shoulders,
dark and rich, with at once a shadow and a light in its abundance,
and imparting the charm of softness to her features. There
played around her mouth, and beamed out of her eyes, a radiant
and tender smile, that seemed gushing from the very heart of<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[250]" id="pgepubid00265"><a id="Page_250" title="[250]"></a></span>
womanhood. A crimson flush was glowing on her cheek, that
had been long so pale. Her sex, her youth, and the whole richness
of her beauty, came back from what men call the irrevocable
past, and clustered themselves, with her maiden hope, and a
happiness before unknown, within the magic circle of this hour.
And, as if the gloom of the earth and sky had been but the
effluence of these two mortal hearts, it vanished with their sorrow.
All at once, as with a sudden smile of heaven, forth burst the
sunshine, pouring a very flood into the obscure forest, gladdening
each green leaf, transmuting the yellow fallen ones to gold, and
gleaming adown the gray trunks of the solemn trees. The objects
that had made a shadow hitherto, embodied the brightness now.
The course of the little brook might be traced by its merry gleam
afar into the wood’s heart of mystery, which had become a mystery
of joy.</p>
<p>Such was the sympathy of Nature—that wild, heathen Nature
of the forest, never subjugated by human law, nor illumined by
higher truth—with the bliss of these two spirits! Love, whether
newly born, or aroused from a death-like slumber, must always
create a sunshine, filling the heart so full of radiance, that it
overflows upon the outward world. Had the forest still kept
its gloom, it would have been bright in Hester’s eyes, and
bright in Arthur Dimmesdale’s!</p>
<p>Hester looked at him with the thrill of another joy.</p>
<p>“Thou must know Pearl!” said she. “Our little Pearl!
Thou hast seen her,—yes, I know it!—but thou wilt see her
now with other eyes. She is a strange child! I hardly comprehend
her! But thou wilt love her dearly, as I do, and wilt
advise me how to deal with her.”</p>
<p>“Dost thou think the child will be glad to know me?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[251]" id="pgepubid00266"><a id="Page_251" title="[251]"></a></span>”
asked the minister, somewhat uneasily. “I have long shrunk
from children, because they often show a distrust,—a backwardness
to be familiar with me. I have even been afraid of
little Pearl!”</p>
<p>“Ah, that was sad!” answered the mother. “But she will
love thee dearly, and thou her. She is not far off. I will call
her! Pearl! Pearl!”</p>
<p>“I see the child,” observed the minister. “Yonder she is,
standing in a streak of sunshine, a good way off, on the other
side of the brook. So thou thinkest the child will love me?”</p>
<p>Hester smiled, and again called to Pearl, who was visible, at
some distance, as the minister had described her, like a bright-apparelled
vision, in a sunbeam, which fell down upon her
through an arch of boughs. The ray quivered to and fro, making
her figure dim or distinct,—now like a real child, now like
a child’s spirit,—as the splendor went and came again. She
heard her mother’s voice, and approached slowly through the
forest.</p>
<p>Pearl had not found the hour pass wearisomely, while her
mother sat talking with the clergyman. The great black forest—stern
as it showed itself to those who brought the guilt and
troubles of the world into its bosom—became the playmate of
the lonely infant, as well as it knew how. Sombre as it was,
it put on the kindest of its moods to welcome her. It offered
her the partridge-berries, the growth of the preceding autumn,
but ripening only in the spring, and now red as drops of blood
upon the withered leaves. These Pearl gathered, and was pleased
with their wild flavor. The small denizens of the wilderness
hardly took pains to move out of her path. A partridge, indeed,
with a brood of ten behind her, ran forward threateningly, but<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[252]" id="pgepubid00267"><a id="Page_252" title="[252]"></a></span>
soon repented of her fierceness, and clucked to her young ones
not to be afraid. A pigeon, alone on a low branch, allowed
Pearl to come beneath, and uttered a sound as much of greeting
as alarm. A squirrel, from the lofty depths of his domestic
tree, chattered either in anger or merriment,—for a squirrel is
such a choleric and humorous little personage, that it is hard to
distinguish between his moods,—so he chattered at the child, and
flung down a nut upon her head. It was a last year’s nut,
and already gnawed by his sharp tooth. A fox, startled from
his sleep by her light footstep on the leaves, looked inquisitively
at Pearl, as doubting whether it were better to steal off, or
renew his nap on the same spot. A wolf, it is said,—but here
the tale has surely lapsed into the improbable,—came up, and
smelt of Pearl’s robe, and offered his savage head to be patted
by her hand. The truth seems to be, however, that the mother-forest,
and these wild things which it nourished, all recognized
a kindred wildness in the human child.</p>
<p>And she was gentler here than in the grassy-margined streets
of the settlement, or in her mother’s cottage. The flowers
appeared to know it; and one and another whispered as she
passed, “Adorn thyself with me, thou beautiful child, adorn
thyself with me!”—and, to please them, Pearl gathered the
violets, and anemones, and columbines, and some twigs of the
freshest green, which the old trees held down before her eyes.
With these she decorated her hair, and her young waist, and
became a nymph-child, or an infant dryad, or whatever else was
in closest sympathy with the antique wood. In such guise had
Pearl adorned herself, when she heard her mother’s voice, and
came slowly back.</p>
<p>Slowly; for she saw the clergyman.</p>
