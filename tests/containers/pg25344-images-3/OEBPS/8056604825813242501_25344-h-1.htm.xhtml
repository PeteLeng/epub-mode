<p>“I will not speak!” answered Hester, turning pale as death,
but responding to this voice, which she too surely recognized.
“And my child must seek a heavenly Father; she shall never
know an earthly one!”</p>
<p>“She will not speak!” murmured Mr. Dimmesdale, who,
leaning over the balcony, with his hand upon his heart, had
awaited the result of his appeal. He now drew back, with a
long respiration. “Wondrous strength and generosity of a woman’s
heart! She will not speak!”</p>
<p>Discerning the impracticable state of the poor culprit’s mind,
the elder clergyman, who had carefully prepared himself for the
occasion, addressed to the multitude a discourse on sin, in all
its branches, but with continual reference to the ignominious
letter. So forcibly did he dwell upon this symbol, for the hour
or more during which his periods were rolling over the people’s
heads, that it
assumed new
terrors in
their imagination,
and
seemed to derive
its scarlet
hue from
the flames of
the infernal pit. Hester
Prynne, meanwhile,
kept her place upon the
pedestal of shame, with
glazed eyes, and an air
of weary indifference.
She had borne, that
morning, all that nature
could endure; and as
her temperament was
not of the order that
escapes from too intense suffering by a swoon, her spirit could
only shelter itself beneath a stony crust of insensibility, while
the faculties of animal life remained entire. In this state, the
voice of the preacher thundered remorselessly, but unavailingly,
upon her ears. The infant, during the latter portion of her<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[79]" id="pgepubid00083"><a id="Page_79" title="[79]"></a></span>
ordeal, pierced the air with its wailings and screams; she strove
to hush it, mechanically, but seemed scarcely to sympathize with
its trouble. With the same hard demeanor, she was led back to
prison, and vanished from the public gaze within its iron-clamped
portal. It was whispered, by those who peered after her, that
the scarlet letter threw a lurid gleam along the dark passage-way
of the interior.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">fter</span> her return to the prison, Hester Prynne
was found to be in a state of nervous excitement
that demanded constant watchfulness,
lest she should perpetrate violence on herself,
or do some half-frenzied mischief to the poor
babe. As night approached, it proving impossible
to quell her insubordination by rebuke or threats of punishment,
Master Brackett, the jailer, thought fit to introduce a
physician. He described him as a man of skill in all Christian
modes of physical science, and likewise familiar with whatever
the savage people could teach, in respect to medicinal herbs and
roots that grew in the forest. To say the truth, there was much
need of professional assistance, not merely for Hester herself,
but still more urgently for the child; who, drawing its sustenance
from the maternal bosom, seemed to have drank in with it
all the turmoil, the anguish and despair, which pervaded the
mother’s system. It now writhed in convulsions of pain, and
was a forcible type, in its little frame, of the moral agony which
Hester Prynne had borne throughout the day.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[81]"><a id="Page_81" title="[81]"></a></span></p>
<p>Closely following the jailer into the dismal apartment appeared
that individual, of singular aspect, whose presence in the crowd
had been of such deep interest to the wearer of the scarlet letter.
He was lodged in the prison, not as suspected of any offence,
but as the most convenient and suitable mode of disposing of
him, until the magistrates should have conferred with the Indian
sagamores respecting his ransom. His name was announced as
Roger Chillingworth. The jailer, after ushering him into the
room, remained a moment, marvelling at the comparative quiet
that followed his entrance; for Hester Prynne had immediately
become as still as death, although the child continued to moan.</p>
<p>“Prithee, friend, leave me alone with my patient,” said the
practitioner. “Trust me, good jailer, you shall briefly have
peace in your house; and, I promise you, Mistress Prynne shall
hereafter be more amenable to just authority than you may have
found her heretofore.”</p>
<p>“Nay, if your worship can accomplish that,” answered Master
Brackett, “I shall own you for a man of skill indeed! Verily,
the woman hath been like a possessed one; and there lacks little,
that I should take in hand to drive Satan out of her with stripes.”</p>
<p>The stranger had entered the room with the characteristic
quietude of the profession to which he announced himself as
belonging. Nor did his demeanor change, when the withdrawal
of the prison-keeper left him face to face with the woman, whose
absorbed notice of him, in the crowd, had intimated so close a relation
between himself and her. His first care was given to the
child; whose cries, indeed, as she lay writhing on the trundle-bed,
made it of peremptory necessity to postpone all other business
to the task of soothing her. He examined the infant carefully,
and then proceeded to unclasp a leathern case, which he took<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[82]" id="pgepubid00087"><a id="Page_82" title="[82]"></a></span>
from beneath his dress. It appeared to contain medical preparations,
one of which he mingled with a cup of water.</p>
<p>“My old studies in alchemy,” observed he, “and my sojourn,
for above a year past, among a people well versed in the kindly
properties of simples, have made a better physician of me than
many that claim the medical degree. Here, woman! The child
is yours,—she is none of mine,—neither will she recognize my
voice or aspect as a father’s. Administer this draught, therefore,
with thine own hand.”</p>
<p>Hester repelled the offered medicine, at the same time gazing
with strongly marked apprehension into his face.</p>
<p>“Wouldst thou avenge thyself on the innocent babe?” whispered
she.</p>
<p>“Foolish woman!” responded the physician, half coldly, half
soothingly. “What should ail me, to harm this misbegotten
and miserable babe? The medicine is potent for good; and were
it my child,—yea, mine own, as well as thine!—I could do no
better for it.”</p>
<p>As she still hesitated, being, in fact, in no reasonable state of
mind, he took the infant in his arms, and himself administered
the draught. It soon proved its efficacy, and redeemed the
leech’s pledge. The moans of the little patient subsided; its
convulsive tossings gradually ceased; and, in a few moments, as
is the custom of young children after relief from pain, it sank into
a profound and dewy slumber. The physician, as he had a fair
right to be termed, next bestowed his attention on the mother.
With calm and intent scrutiny he felt her pulse, looked into her
eyes,—a gaze that made her heart shrink and shudder, because
so familiar, and yet so strange and cold,—and, finally, satisfied
with his investigation, proceeded to mingle another draught.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[83]" id="pgepubid00088"><a id="Page_83" title="[83]"></a></span></p>
<p>“I know not Lethe nor Nepenthe,” remarked he; “but I
have learned many new secrets in the wilderness, and here is
one of them,—a recipe that an Indian taught me, in requital
of some lessons of my own, that were as old as Paracelsus. Drink
it! It may be less soothing than a sinless conscience. That I
cannot give thee. But it will calm the swell and heaving of thy
passion, like oil thrown on the waves of a tempestuous sea.”</p>
<p>He presented the cup to Hester, who received it with a slow,
earnest look into his face; not precisely a look of fear, yet full
of doubt and questioning, as to what his purposes might be.
She looked also at her slumbering child.</p>
<p>“I have thought of death,” said she,—“have wished for it,—would
even have prayed for it, were it fit that such as I
should pray for anything. Yet if death be in this cup, I bid
thee think again, ere thou beholdest me quaff it. See! It is
even now at my lips.”</p>
<p>“Drink, then,” replied he, still with the same cold composure.
“Dost thou know me so little, Hester Prynne? Are my purposes
wont to be so shallow? Even if I imagine a scheme of
vengeance, what could I do better for my object than to let
thee live,—than to give thee medicines against all harm and
peril of life,—so that this burning shame may still blaze upon
thy bosom?” As he spoke, he laid his long forefinger on the
scarlet letter, which forthwith seemed to scorch into Hester’s
breast, as if it had been red-hot. He noticed her involuntary
gesture, and smiled. “Live, therefore, and bear about thy doom
with thee, in the eyes of men and women,—in the eyes of him
whom thou didst call thy husband,—in the eyes of yonder
child! And, that thou mayest live, take off this draught.”</p>
<p>Without further expostulation or delay, Hester Prynne drained<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[84]" id="pgepubid00089"><a id="Page_84" title="[84]"></a></span>
the cup, and, at the motion of the man of skill, seated herself
on the bed where the child was sleeping; while he drew the only
chair which the room afforded, and took his own seat beside her.
She could not but tremble at these preparations; for she felt
that—having now done all that humanity or principle, or, if so
it were, a refined cruelty, impelled him to do, for the relief of
physical suffering—he was next to treat with her as the man
whom she had most deeply and irreparably injured.</p>
<p>“Hester,” said he, “I ask not wherefore, nor how, thou hast
fallen into the pit, or say, rather, thou hast ascended to the
pedestal of infamy, on which I found thee. The reason is not
far to seek. It was my folly, and thy weakness. I,—a man
of thought,—the bookworm of great libraries,—a man already
in decay, having given my best years to feed the hungry dream
of knowledge,—what had I to do with youth and beauty like
thine own! Misshapen from my birth-hour, how could I delude
myself with the idea that intellectual gifts might veil physical
deformity in a young girl’s fantasy! Men call me wise. If
sages were ever wise in their own behoof, I might have foreseen
all this. I might have known that, as I came out of the vast
and dismal forest, and entered this settlement of Christian men,
the very first object to meet my eyes would be thyself, Hester
Prynne, standing up, a statue of ignominy, before the people.
Nay, from the moment when we came down the old church steps
together, a married pair, I might have beheld the bale-fire of
that scarlet letter blazing at the end of our path!”</p>
<p>“Thou knowest,” said Hester,—for, depressed as she was, she
could not endure this last quiet stab at the token of her shame,—“thou
knowest that I was frank with thee. I felt no love,
nor feigned any.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[85]" id="pgepubid00090"><a id="Page_85" title="[85]"></a></span>”</p>
<p>“True,” replied he. “It was my folly! I have said it. But,
up to that epoch of my life, I had lived in vain. The world
had been so cheerless! My heart was a habitation large enough
for many guests, but lonely and chill, and without a household
fire. I longed to kindle one! It seemed not so wild a dream,—old
as I was, and sombre as I was, and misshapen as I was,—that
the simple bliss, which is scattered far and wide, for all
mankind to gather up, might yet be mine. And so, Hester, I
drew thee into my heart, into its innermost chamber, and sought
to warm thee by the warmth which thy presence made there!”</p>
<p>“I have greatly wronged thee,” murmured Hester.</p>
<p>“We have wronged each other,” answered he. “Mine was
the first wrong, when I betrayed thy budding youth into a false
and unnatural relation with my decay. Therefore, as a man who
has not thought and philosophized in vain, I seek no vengeance,
plot no evil against thee. Between thee and me the scale hangs
fairly balanced. But, Hester, the man lives who has wronged us
both! Who is he?”</p>
<p>“Ask me not!” replied Hester Prynne, looking firmly into his
face. “That thou shalt never know!”</p>
<p>“Never, sayest thou?” rejoined he, with a smile of dark and
self-relying intelligence. “Never know him! Believe me, Hester,
there are few things,—whether in the outward world, or, to
a certain depth, in the invisible sphere of thought,—few things
hidden from the man who devotes himself earnestly and unreservedly
to the solution of a mystery. Thou mayest cover up
thy secret from the prying multitude. Thou mayest conceal it,
too, from the ministers and magistrates, even as thou didst this
day, when they sought to wrench the name out of thy heart, and
give thee a partner on thy pedestal. But, as for me, I come to<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[86]" id="pgepubid00091"><a id="Page_86" title="[86]"></a></span>
the inquest with other senses than they possess. I shall seek
this man, as I have sought truth in books; as I have sought
gold in alchemy. There is a sympathy that will make me conscious
of him. I shall see him tremble. I shall feel myself
shudder, suddenly and unawares. Sooner or later, he must needs
be mine!”</p>
<p>The eyes of the wrinkled scholar glowed so intensely upon her,
that Hester Prynne clasped her hands over her heart, dreading
lest he should read the secret there at once.</p>
<p>“Thou wilt not reveal his name? Not the less he is mine,”
resumed he, with a look of confidence, as if destiny were at one
with him. “He bears no letter of infamy wrought into his garment,
as thou dost; but I shall read it on his heart. Yet fear
not for him! Think not that I shall interfere with Heaven’s
own method of retribution, or, to my own loss, betray him to the
gripe of human law. Neither do thou imagine that I shall contrive
aught against his life; no, nor against his fame, if, as I
judge, he be a man of fair repute. Let him live! Let him
hide himself in outward honor, if he may! Not the less he
shall be mine!”</p>
<p>“Thy acts are like mercy,” said Hester, bewildered and appalled.
“But thy words interpret thee as a terror!”</p>
<p>“One thing, thou that wast my wife, I would enjoin upon
thee,” continued the scholar. “Thou hast kept the secret of thy
paramour. Keep, likewise, mine! There are none in this land
that know me. Breathe not, to any human soul, that thou didst
ever call me husband! Here, on this wild outskirt of the earth,
I shall pitch my tent; for, elsewhere a wanderer, and isolated
from human interests, I find here a woman, a man, a child,
amongst whom and myself there exist the closest ligaments. No
matter whether of love or hate; no matter whether of right or
wrong! Thou and thine, Hester Prynne, belong to me. My
home is where thou art, and where he is. But betray me
not!”</p>

<p>“Wherefore dost thou desire it?” inquired Hester, shrinking,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[88]" id="pgepubid00093"><a id="Page_88" title="[88]"></a></span>
she hardly knew why, from this secret bond. “Why not announce
thyself openly, and cast me off at once?”</p>
<p>“It may be,” he replied, “because I will not encounter the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[89]" id="pgepubid00094"><a id="Page_89" title="[89]"></a></span>
dishonor that besmirches the husband of a faithless woman. It
may be for other reasons. Enough, it is my purpose to live
and die unknown. Let, therefore, thy husband be to the world
as one already dead, and of whom no tidings shall ever come.
Recognize me not, by word, by sign, by look! Breathe not the
secret, above all, to the man thou wottest of. Shouldst thou
fail me in this, beware! His fame, his position, his life, will be
in my hands. Beware!”</p>
<p>“I will keep thy secret, as I have his,” said Hester.</p>
<p>“Swear it!” rejoined he.</p>
<p>And she took the oath.</p>
<p>“And now, Mistress Prynne,” said old Roger Chillingworth,
as he was hereafter to be named, “I leave thee alone; alone
with thy infant, and the scarlet letter! How is it, Hester?
Doth thy sentence bind thee to wear the token in thy sleep?
Art thou not afraid of nightmares and hideous dreams?”</p>
<p>“Why dost thou smile so at me?” inquired Hester, troubled
at the expression of his eyes. “Art thou like the Black Man
that haunts the forest round about us? Hast thou enticed me
into a bond that will prove the ruin of my soul?”</p>
<p>“Not thy soul,” he answered, with another smile. “No, not
thine!”</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">ester</span> Prynne’s term of confinement was
now at an end. Her prison-door was thrown
open, and she came forth into the sunshine,
which, falling on all alike, seemed, to her
sick and morbid heart, as if meant for no
other purpose than to reveal the scarlet letter
on her breast. Perhaps there was a more real torture in her
first unattended footsteps from the threshold of the prison, than
even in the procession and spectacle that have been described,
where she was made the common infamy, at which all mankind
was summoned to point its finger. Then, she was supported by
an unnatural tension of the nerves, and by all the combative
energy of her character, which enabled her to convert the scene
into a kind of lurid triumph. It was, moreover, a separate and
insulated event, to occur but once in her lifetime, and to meet
which, therefore, reckless of economy, she might call up the vital
strength that would have sufficed for many quiet years. The
very law that condemned her—a giant of stern features, but
with vigor to support, as well as to annihilate, in his iron arm<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[91]"><a id="Page_91" title="[91]"></a></span>—had
held her up, through the terrible ordeal of her ignominy.
But now, with this unattended walk from her prison-door, began
the daily custom; and she must either sustain and carry it
forward by the ordinary resources of her nature, or sink beneath
it. She could no longer borrow from the future to help her
through the present grief. To-morrow would bring its own trial
with it; so would the next day, and so would the next; each its
own trial, and yet the very same that was now so unutterably
grievous to be borne. The days of the far-off future would toil
onward, still with the same burden for her to take up, and bear
along with her, but never to fling down; for the accumulating
days, and added years, would pile up their misery upon the heap
of shame. Throughout them all, giving up her individuality, she
would become the general symbol at which the preacher and
moralist might point, and in which they might vivify and embody
their images of woman’s frailty and sinful passion. Thus the
young and pure would be taught to look at her, with the scarlet
letter flaming on her breast,—at her, the child of honorable
parents,—at her, the mother of a babe, that would hereafter be
a woman,—at her, who had once been innocent,—as the figure,
the body, the reality of sin. And over her grave, the infamy that
she must carry thither would be her only monument.</p>
<p>It may seem marvellous, that, with the world before her,—kept
by no restrictive clause of her condemnation within the
limits of the Puritan settlement, so remote and so obscure,—free
to return to her birthplace, or to any other European land,
and there hide her character and identity under a new exterior,
as completely as if emerging into another state of being,—and
having also the passes of the dark, inscrutable forest open to
her, where the wildness of her nature might assimilate itself with<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[92]" id="pgepubid00098"><a id="Page_92" title="[92]"></a></span>
a people whose customs and life were alien from the law that
had condemned her,—it may seem marvellous, that this woman
should still call that place her home, where, and where only, she
must needs be the type of shame. But there is a fatality, a feeling
so irresistible and inevitable that it has the force of doom,
which almost invariably compels human beings to linger around
and haunt, ghost-like, the spot where some great and marked
event has given the color to their lifetime; and still the more
irresistibly, the darker the tinge that saddens it. Her sin, her
ignominy, were the roots which she had struck into the soil.
It was as if a new birth, with stronger assimilations than the
first, had converted the forest-land, still so uncongenial to every
other pilgrim and wanderer, into Hester Prynne’s wild and dreary,
but life-long home. All other scenes of earth—even that village
of rural England, where happy infancy and stainless maidenhood
seemed yet to be in her mother’s keeping, like garments put
off long ago—were foreign to her, in comparison. The chain
that bound her here was of iron links, and galling to her inmost
soul, but could never be broken.</p>
<p>It might be, too,—doubtless it was so, although she hid the
secret from herself, and grew pale whenever it struggled out
of her heart, like a serpent from its hole,—it might be that
another feeling kept her within the scene and pathway that had
been so fatal. There dwelt, there trode the feet of one with
whom she deemed herself connected in a union, that, unrecognized
on earth, would bring them together before the bar of
final judgment, and make that their marriage-altar, for a joint
futurity of endless retribution. Over and over again, the tempter
of souls had thrust this idea upon Hester’s contemplation, and
laughed at the passionate and desperate joy with which she<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[93]" id="pgepubid00099"><a id="Page_93" title="[93]"></a></span>
seized, and then strove to cast it from her. She barely looked
the idea in the face, and hastened to bar it in its dungeon. What
she compelled herself to believe—what, finally, she reasoned
upon, as her motive for continuing a resident of New England—was
half a truth, and half a self-delusion. Here, she
said to herself, had been the scene of her guilt, and here should
be the scene of her earthly punishment; and so, perchance, the
torture of her daily shame would at length purge her soul, and
work out another purity than that which she had lost; more
saint-like, because the result of martyrdom.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="9125950922386535487_illu_093.jpg.id-2588157212981790416.wrap-0.html.xhtml" id="id-2588157212981790416" title="linked image"><img alt="The Lonesome Dwelling" src="9125950922386535487_illu_093_th.jpg" title="The Lonesome Dwelling" id="img_images_illu_093_th.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Hester Prynne, therefore, did not flee. On the outskirts of the
town, within the verge of the peninsula, but not in close vicinity
to any other habitation, there was a small thatched cottage. It
had been built by an earlier settler, and abandoned because the
soil about it was too sterile for cultivation, while its comparative
remoteness put it out of the sphere of that social activity
which already marked the habits of the emigrants. It stood on
the shore, looking across a basin of the sea at the forest-covered
hills, towards the west. A clump of scrubby trees, such as alone<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[94]" id="pgepubid00100"><a id="Page_94" title="[94]"></a></span>
grew on the peninsula, did not so much conceal the cottage
from view, as seem to denote that here was some object which
would fain have been, or at least ought to be, concealed. In
this little, lonesome dwelling, with some slender means that she
possessed, and by the license of the magistrates, who still kept
an inquisitorial watch over her, Hester established herself, with
her infant child. A mystic shadow of suspicion immediately
attached itself to the spot. Children, too young to comprehend
wherefore this woman should be shut out from the sphere
of human charities, would creep nigh enough to behold her
plying her needle at the cottage-window, or standing in the
doorway, or laboring in her little garden, or coming forth along
the pathway that led townward; and, discerning the scarlet
letter on her breast, would scamper off with a strange, contagious
fear.</p>
<p>Lonely as was Hester’s situation, and without a friend on
earth who dared to show himself, she, however, incurred no risk
of want. She possessed an art that sufficed, even in a land that
afforded comparatively little scope for its exercise, to supply food
for her thriving infant and herself. It was the art—then, as
now, almost the only one within a woman’s grasp—of needlework.
She bore on her breast, in the curiously embroidered
letter, a specimen of her delicate and imaginative skill, of which
the dames of a court might gladly have availed themselves, to
add the richer and more spiritual adornment of human ingenuity
to their fabrics of silk and gold. Here, indeed, in the sable
simplicity that generally characterized the Puritanic modes of
dress, there might be an infrequent call for the finer productions
of her handiwork. Yet the taste of the age, demanding whatever
was elaborate in compositions of this kind, did not fail to<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[95]" id="pgepubid00101"><a id="Page_95" title="[95]"></a></span>
extend its influence over our stern progenitors, who had cast
behind them so many fashions which it might seem harder to
dispense with. Public ceremonies, such as ordinations, the installation
of magistrates, and all that could give majesty to the forms
in which a new government manifested itself to the people, were,
as a matter of policy, marked by a stately and well-conducted
ceremonial, and a sombre, but yet a studied magnificence. Deep
ruffs, painfully wrought bands, and gorgeously embroidered gloves,
were all deemed necessary to the official state of men assuming
the reins of power; and were readily allowed to individuals
dignified by rank or wealth, even while sumptuary laws forbade
these and similar extravagances to the plebeian order. In the
array of funerals, too,—whether for the apparel of the dead
body, or to typify, by manifold emblematic devices of sable cloth
and snowy lawn, the sorrow of the survivors,—there was a frequent
and characteristic demand for such labor as Hester Prynne
could supply. Baby-linen—for babies then wore robes of state—afforded
still another possibility of toil and emolument.</p>
<p>By degrees, nor very slowly, her handiwork became what would
now be termed the fashion. Whether from commiseration for
a woman of so miserable a destiny; or from the morbid curiosity
that gives a fictitious value even to common or worthless
things; or by whatever other intangible circumstance was then,
as now, sufficient to bestow, on some persons, what others might
seek in vain; or because Hester really filled a gap which must
otherwise have remained vacant; it is certain that she had ready
and fairly requited employment for as many hours as she saw
fit to occupy with her needle. Vanity, it may be, chose to
mortify itself, by putting on, for ceremonials of pomp and state,
the garments that had been wrought by her sinful hands. Her<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[96]" id="pgepubid00102"><a id="Page_96" title="[96]"></a></span>
needlework was seen on the ruff of the Governor; military men
wore it on their scarfs, and the minister on his band; it decked
the baby’s little cap; it was shut up, to be mildewed and moulder
away, in the coffins of the dead. But it is not recorded that,
in a single instance, her skill was called in aid to embroider
the white veil which was to cover the pure blushes of a bride.
The exception indicated the ever-relentless rigor with which society
frowned upon her sin.</p>
<p>Hester sought not to acquire anything beyond a subsistence,
of the plainest and most ascetic description, for herself, and
a simple abundance for her child. Her own dress was of the
coarsest materials and the most sombre hue; with only that one
ornament,—the scarlet letter,—which it was her doom to wear.
The child’s attire, on the other hand, was distinguished by a
fanciful, or, we might rather say, a fantastic ingenuity, which
served, indeed, to heighten the airy charm that early began to
develop itself in the little girl, but which appeared to have also
a deeper meaning. We may speak further of it hereafter. Except
for that small expenditure in the decoration of her infant, Hester
bestowed all her superfluous means in charity, on wretches less
miserable than herself, and who not unfrequently insulted the
hand that fed them. Much of the time, which she might readily
have applied to the better efforts of her art, she employed in
making coarse garments for the poor. It is probable that there
was an idea of penance in this mode of occupation, and that she
offered up a real sacrifice of enjoyment, in devoting so many
hours to such rude handiwork. She had in her nature a rich,
voluptuous, Oriental characteristic,—a taste for the gorgeously
beautiful, which, save in the exquisite productions of her needle,
found nothing else, in all the possibilities of her life, to exercise<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[97]" id="pgepubid00103"><a id="Page_97" title="[97]"></a></span>
itself upon. Women derive a pleasure, incomprehensible to
the other sex, from the delicate toil of the needle. To Hester
Prynne it might have been a mode of expressing, and therefore
soothing, the passion of her life. Like all other joys, she rejected
it as sin. This morbid meddling of conscience with an immaterial
matter betokened, it is to be feared, no genuine and steadfast
penitence, but something doubtful, something that might
be deeply wrong, beneath.</p>
<p>In this manner, Hester Prynne came to have a part to perform
in the world. With her native energy of character, and rare
capacity, it could not entirely cast her off, although it had set
a mark upon her, more intolerable to a woman’s heart than that
which branded the brow of Cain. In all her intercourse with
society, however, there was nothing that made her feel as if she
belonged to it. Every gesture, every word, and even the silence
of those with whom she came in contact, implied, and often
expressed, that she was banished, and as much alone as if she
inhabited another sphere, or communicated with the common
nature by other organs and senses than the rest of human kind.
She stood apart from moral interests, yet close beside them, like
a ghost that revisits the familiar fireside, and can no longer make
itself seen or felt; no more smile with the household joy, nor
mourn with the kindred sorrow; or, should it succeed in manifesting
its forbidden sympathy, awakening only terror and horrible
repugnance. These emotions, in fact, and its bitterest scorn
besides, seemed to be the sole portion that she retained in the
universal heart. It was not an age of delicacy; and her position,
although she understood it well, and was in little danger
of forgetting it, was often brought before her vivid self-perception,
like a new anguish, by the rudest touch upon the tenderest spot.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[98]" id="pgepubid00104"><a id="Page_98" title="[98]"></a></span>
The poor, as we have already said, whom she sought out to be
the objects of her bounty, often reviled the hand that was stretched
forth to succor them. Dames of elevated rank, likewise, whose
doors she entered in the way of her occupation, were accustomed
to distil drops of bitterness into her heart; sometimes through
that alchemy of quiet malice, by which women can concoct a
subtle poison from ordinary trifles; and sometimes, also, by
a coarser expression, that fell upon the sufferer’s defenceless
breast like a rough blow upon an ulcerated wound. Hester had
schooled herself long and well; she never responded to these
attacks, save by a flush of crimson that rose irrepressibly over
her pale cheek, and again subsided into the depths of her bosom.
She was patient,—a martyr, indeed,—but she forbore to pray
for her enemies; lest, in spite of her forgiving aspirations, the
words of the blessing should stubbornly twist themselves into
a curse.</p>
<p>Continually, and in a thousand other ways, did she feel the
innumerable throbs of anguish that had been so cunningly contrived
for her by the undying, the ever-active sentence of the
Puritan tribunal. Clergymen paused in the street to address
words of exhortation, that brought a crowd, with its mingled
grin and frown, around the poor, sinful woman. If she entered
a church, trusting to share the Sabbath smile of the Universal
Father, it was often her mishap to find herself the text of the
discourse. She grew to have a dread of children; for they had
imbibed from their parents a vague idea of something horrible
in this dreary woman, gliding silently through the town, with
never any companion but one only child. Therefore, first allowing
her to pass, they pursued her at a distance with shrill cries,
and the utterance of a word that had no distinct purport to
their own minds, but was none the less terrible to her, as proceeding
from lips that babbled it unconsciously. It seemed to
argue so wide a diffusion of her shame, that all nature knew
of it; it could have caused her no deeper pang, had the leaves
of the trees whispered the dark story among themselves,—had
the summer breeze murmured about it,—had the wintry blast
shrieked it aloud! Another peculiar torture was felt in the gaze
of a new eye. When strangers looked curiously at the scarlet
letter,—and none ever failed to do so,—they branded it afresh
into Hester’s soul; so that, oftentimes, she could scarcely refrain,
yet always did refrain, from covering the symbol with her hand.
But then, again, an accustomed eye had likewise its own anguish
to inflict. Its cool stare of familiarity was intolerable. From
first to last, in short, Hester Prynne had always this dreadful
agony in feeling a human eye upon the token; the spot never
grew callous; it seemed, on the contrary, to grow more sensitive
with daily torture.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[99]" id="pgepubid00105"><a id="Page_99" title="[99]"></a></span><a href="9125950922386535487_illu_099.jpg.id-5576396356311581822.wrap-0.html.xhtml" id="id-5576396356311581822" title="linked image"><img alt="Lonely Footsteps" src="9125950922386535487_illu_099_th.jpg" title="Lonely Footsteps" id="img_images_illu_099_th.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>But sometimes, once in many days, or perchance in many
months, she felt an eye—a human eye—upon the ignominious
brand, that seemed to give a momentary relief, as if half of her<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[100]" id="pgepubid00106"><a id="Page_100" title="[100]"></a></span>
agony were shared. The next instant, back it all rushed again,
with still a deeper throb of pain; for, in that brief interval,
she had sinned anew. Had Hester sinned alone?</p>
<p>Her imagination was somewhat affected, and, had she been<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[101]" id="pgepubid00107"><a id="Page_101" title="[101]"></a></span>
of a softer moral and intellectual fibre, would have been still
more so, by the strange and solitary anguish of her life. Walking
to and fro, with those lonely footsteps, in the little world
with which she was outwardly connected, it now and then appeared
to Hester,—if altogether fancy, it was nevertheless too potent
to be resisted,—she felt or fancied, then, that the scarlet letter<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[102]"><a id="Page_102" title="[102]"></a></span>
had endowed her with a new sense. She shuddered to believe,
yet could not help believing, that it gave her a sympathetic
knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts. She was terror-stricken
by the revelations that were thus made. What were
they? Could they be other than the insidious whispers of the
bad angel, who would fain have persuaded the struggling woman,
as yet only half his victim, that the outward guise of purity
was but a lie, and that, if truth were everywhere to be shown,
a scarlet letter would blaze forth on many a bosom besides Hester
Prynne’s? Or, must she receive those intimations—so obscure,
yet so distinct—as truth? In all her miserable experience, there
was nothing else so awful and so loathsome as this sense. It
perplexed, as well as shocked her, by the irreverent inopportuneness
of the occasions that brought it into vivid action. Sometimes
the red infamy upon her breast would give a sympathetic
throb, as she passed near a venerable minister or magistrate,
the model of piety and justice, to whom that age of antique
reverence looked up, as to a mortal man in fellowship with angels.
“What evil thing is at hand?” would Hester say to herself.
Lifting her reluctant eyes, there would be nothing human within
the scope of view, save the form of this earthly saint! Again,
a mystic sisterhood would contumaciously assert itself, as she
met the sanctified frown of some matron, who, according to the
rumor of all tongues, had kept cold snow within her bosom
throughout life. That unsunned snow in the matron’s bosom,
and the burning shame on Hester Prynne’s,—what had the two
in common? Or, once more, the electric thrill would give her
warning,—“Behold, Hester, here is a companion!”—and, looking
up, she would detect the eyes of a young maiden glancing
at the scarlet letter, shyly and aside, and quickly averted with<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[103]"><a id="Page_103" title="[103]"></a></span>
a faint, chill crimson in her cheeks; as if her purity were somewhat
sullied by that momentary glance. O Fiend, whose talisman
was that fatal symbol, wouldst thou leave nothing, whether in
youth or age, for this poor sinner to revere?—such loss of faith
is ever one of the saddest results of sin. Be it accepted as a proof
that all was not corrupt in this poor victim of her own frailty,
and man’s hard law, that Hester Prynne yet struggled to believe
that no fellow-mortal was guilty like herself.</p>
<p>The vulgar, who, in those dreary old times, were always contributing
a grotesque horror to what interested their imaginations,
had a story about the scarlet letter which we might readily work
up into a terrific legend. They averred, that the symbol was
not mere scarlet cloth, tinged in an earthly dye-pot, but was
red-hot with infernal fire, and could be seen glowing all alight,
whenever Hester Prynne walked abroad in the night-time. And
we must needs say, it seared Hester’s bosom so deeply, that
perhaps there was more truth in the rumor than our modern
incredulity may be inclined to admit.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">We</span> have as yet hardly spoken
of the infant; that little creature,
whose innocent life had
sprung, by the inscrutable decree
of Providence, a lovely
and immortal flower, out of
the rank luxuriance of a guilty
passion. How strange it seemed
to the sad woman, as she
watched the growth, and the
beauty that became every day
more brilliant, and the intelligence
that threw its quivering
sunshine over the tiny features
of this child! Her Pearl!—For
so had Hester called her;
not as a name expressive of her aspect, which had nothing of
the calm, white, unimpassioned lustre that would be indicated
by the comparison. But she named the infant “Pearl,” as being<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[105]"><a id="Page_105" title="[105]"></a></span>
of great price,—purchased with all she had,—her mother’s only
treasure! How strange, indeed! Man had marked this woman’s
sin by a scarlet letter, which had such potent and disastrous
efficacy that no human sympathy could reach her, save it were
sinful like herself. God, as a direct consequence of the sin which
man thus punished, had given her a lovely child, whose place
was on that same dishonored bosom, to connect her parent forever
with the race and descent of mortals, and to be finally a blessed
soul in heaven! Yet these thoughts affected Hester Prynne less
with hope than apprehension. She knew that her deed had been
evil; she could have no faith, therefore, that its result would
be good. Day after day, she looked fearfully into the child’s
expanding nature, ever dreading to detect some dark and wild
peculiarity, that should correspond with the guiltiness to which
she owed her being.</p>
<p>Certainly, there was no physical defect. By its perfect shape,
its vigor, and its natural dexterity in the use of all its untried
limbs, the infant was worthy to have been brought forth in Eden;
worthy to have been left there, to be the plaything of the angels,
after the world’s first parents were driven out. The child had a
native grace which does not invariably coexist with faultless
beauty; its attire, however simple, always impressed the beholder
as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best. But
little Pearl was not clad in rustic weeds. Her mother, with a
morbid purpose that may be better understood hereafter, had
bought the richest tissues that could be procured, and allowed
her imaginative faculty its full play in the arrangement and decoration
of the dresses which the child wore, before the public eye.
So magnificent was the small figure, when thus arrayed, and such
was the splendor of Pearl’s own proper beauty, shining through<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[106]" id="pgepubid00111"><a id="Page_106" title="[106]"></a></span>
the gorgeous robes which might have extinguished a paler loveliness,
that there was an absolute circle of radiance around her,
on the darksome cottage floor. And yet a russet gown, torn
and soiled with the child’s rude play, made a picture of her just
as perfect. Pearl’s aspect was imbued with a spell of infinite
variety; in this one child there were many children, comprehending
the full scope between the wild-flower prettiness of a
peasant-baby, and the pomp, in little, of an infant princess.
Throughout all, however, there was a trait of passion, a certain
depth of hue, which she never lost; and if, in any of her changes,
she had grown fainter or paler, she would have ceased to be herself,—it
would have been no longer Pearl!</p>
<p>This outward mutability indicated, and did not more than fairly
express, the various properties of her inner life. Her nature
appeared to possess depth, too, as well as variety; but—or else
Hester’s fears deceived her—it lacked reference and adaptation
to the world into which she was born. The child could not be
made amenable to rules. In giving her existence, a great law
had been broken; and the result was a being whose elements
were perhaps beautiful and brilliant, but all in disorder; or with
an order peculiar to themselves, amidst which the point of variety
and arrangement was difficult or impossible to be discovered.
Hester could only account for the child’s character—and even
then most vaguely and imperfectly—by recalling what she herself
had been, during that momentous period while Pearl was
imbibing her soul from the spiritual world, and her bodily frame
from its material of earth. The mother’s impassioned state had
been the medium through which were transmitted to the unborn
infant the rays of its moral life; and, however white and clear
originally, they had taken the deep stains of crimson and gold,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[107]" id="pgepubid00112"><a id="Page_107" title="[107]"></a></span>
the fiery lustre, the black shadow, and the untempered light of
the intervening substance. Above all, the warfare of Hester’s
spirit, at that epoch, was perpetuated in Pearl. She could recognize
her wild, desperate, defiant mood, the flightiness of her
temper, and even some of the very cloud-shapes of gloom and
despondency that had brooded in her heart. They were now
illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child’s disposition,
but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific
of the storm and whirlwind.</p>
<p>The discipline of the family, in those days, was of a far more
rigid kind than now. The frown, the harsh rebuke, the frequent
application of the rod, enjoined by Scriptural authority, were
used, not merely in the way of punishment for actual offences,
but as a wholesome regimen for the growth and promotion of all
childish virtues. Hester Prynne, nevertheless, the lonely mother
of this one child, ran little risk of erring on the side of undue
severity. Mindful, however, of her own errors and misfortunes,
she early sought to impose a tender, but strict control over the
infant immortality that was committed to her charge. But the
task was beyond her skill. After testing both smiles and frowns,
and proving that neither mode of treatment possessed any calculable
influence, Hester was ultimately compelled to stand aside,
and permit the child to be swayed by her own impulses. Physical
compulsion or restraint was effectual, of course, while it
lasted. As to any other kind of discipline, whether addressed
to her mind or heart, little Pearl might or might not be within
its reach, in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment.
Her mother, while Pearl was yet an infant, grew acquainted with
a certain peculiar look, that warned her when it would be labor
thrown away to insist, persuade, or plead. It was a look so<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[108]" id="pgepubid00113"><a id="Page_108" title="[108]"></a></span>
intelligent, yet inexplicable, so perverse, sometimes so malicious,
but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits, that Hester
could not help questioning, at such moments, whether Pearl were
a human child. She seemed rather an airy sprite, which, after
playing its fantastic sports for a little while upon the cottage
floor, would flit away with a mocking smile. Whenever that
look appeared in her wild, bright, deeply black eyes, it invested
her with a strange remoteness and intangibility; it was as if she
were hovering in the air and might vanish, like a glimmering
light, that comes we know not whence, and goes we know not
whither. Beholding it, Hester was constrained to rush towards
the child,—to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably
began,—to snatch her to her bosom, with a close pressure
and earnest kisses,—not so much from overflowing love, as to
assure herself that Pearl was flesh and blood, and not utterly
delusive. But Pearl’s laugh, when she was caught, though full of
merriment and music, made her mother more doubtful than before.</p>
<p>Heart-smitten at this bewildering and baffling spell, that so
often came between herself and her sole treasure, whom she had
bought so dear, and who was all her world, Hester sometimes
burst into passionate tears. Then, perhaps,—for there was no
foreseeing how it might affect her,—Pearl would frown, and
clench her little fist, and harden her small features into a stern,
unsympathizing look of discontent. Not seldom, she would laugh
anew, and louder than before, like a thing incapable and unintelligent
of human sorrow. Or—but this more rarely happened—she
would be convulsed with a rage of grief, and sob
out her love for her mother, in broken words, and seem intent
on proving that she had a heart, by breaking it. Yet Hester
was hardly safe in confiding herself to that gusty tenderness;<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[109]" id="pgepubid00114"><a id="Page_109" title="[109]"></a></span>
it passed, as suddenly as it came. Brooding over all these
matters, the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit, but,
by some irregularity in the process of conjuration, has failed to
win the master-word that should control this new and incomprehensible
intelligence. Her only real comfort was when the child
lay in the placidity of sleep. Then she was sure of her, and
tasted hours of quiet, sad, delicious happiness; until—perhaps
with that perverse expression glimmering from beneath her opening
lids—little Pearl awoke!</p>
<p>How soon—with what strange rapidity, indeed!—did Pearl
arrive at an age that was capable of social intercourse, beyond
the mother’s ever-ready smile and nonsense-words! And then
what a happiness would it have been, could Hester Prynne have
heard her clear, bird-like voice mingling with the uproar of
other childish voices, and have distinguished and unravelled her
own darling’s tones, amid all the entangled outcry of a group of
sportive children! But this could never be. Pearl was a born
outcast of the infantile world. An imp of evil, emblem and
product of sin, she had no right among christened infants. Nothing
was more remarkable than the instinct, as it seemed, with
which the child comprehended her loneliness; the destiny that
had drawn an inviolable circle round about her; the whole peculiarity,
in short, of her position in respect to other children.
Never, since her release from prison, had Hester met the public
gaze without her. In all her walks about the town, Pearl, too,
was there; first as the babe in arms, and afterwards as the little
girl, small companion of her mother, holding a forefinger with
her whole grasp, and tripping along at the rate of three or four
footsteps to one of Hester’s. She saw the children of the settlement,
on the grassy margin of the street, or at the domestic<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[110]" id="pgepubid00115"><a id="Page_110" title="[110]"></a></span>
thresholds, disporting themselves in such grim fashion as the
Puritanic nurture would permit; playing at going to church,
perchance; or at scourging Quakers; or taking scalps in a
sham-fight with the Indians; or scaring one another with freaks
of imitative witchcraft. Pearl saw, and gazed intently, but never
sought to make acquaintance. If spoken to, she would not speak
again. If the children gathered about her, as they sometimes did,
Pearl would grow positively terrible in her puny wrath, snatching
up stones to fling at them, with shrill, incoherent exclamations,
that made her mother tremble, because they had so much the
sound of a witch’s anathemas in some unknown tongue.</p>
<p>The truth was, that the little Puritans, being of the most intolerant
brood that ever lived, had got a vague idea of something
outlandish, unearthly, or at variance with ordinary fashions, in
the mother and child; and therefore scorned them in their hearts,
and not unfrequently reviled them with their tongues. Pearl felt
the sentiment, and requited it with the bitterest hatred that can
be supposed to rankle in a childish bosom. These outbreaks of
a fierce temper had a kind of value, and even comfort, for her
mother; because there was at least an intelligible earnestness
in the mood, instead of the fitful caprice that so often thwarted
her in the child’s manifestations. It appalled her, nevertheless,
to discern here, again, a shadowy reflection of the evil that had
existed in herself. All this enmity and passion had Pearl inherited,
by inalienable right, out of Hester’s heart. Mother and
daughter stood together in the same circle of seclusion from
human society; and in the nature of the child seemed to be
perpetuated those unquiet elements that had distracted Hester
Prynne before Pearl’s birth, but had since begun to be soothed
away by the softening influences of maternity.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[111]" id="pgepubid00116"><a id="Page_111" title="[111]"></a></span></p>
<p>At home, within and around her mother’s cottage, Pearl wanted
not a wide and various circle of acquaintance. The spell of life
went forth from her ever-creative spirit, and communicated itself
to a thousand objects, as a torch kindles a flame wherever it
may be applied. The unlikeliest materials—a stick, a bunch
of rags, a flower—were the puppets of Pearl’s witchcraft, and,
without undergoing any outward change, became spiritually
adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her inner
world. Her one baby-voice served a multitude of imaginary
personages, old and young, to talk withal. The pine-trees, aged,
black and solemn, and flinging groans and other melancholy
utterances on the breeze, needed little transformation to figure
as Puritan elders; the ugliest weeds of the garden were their
children, whom Pearl smote down and uprooted, most unmercifully.
It was wonderful, the vast variety of forms into which
she threw her intellect, with no continuity, indeed, but darting
up and dancing, always in a state of preternatural activity,—soon
sinking down, as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a
tide of life,—and succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild
energy. It was like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric play
of the northern lights. In the mere exercise of the fancy, however,
and the sportiveness of a growing mind, there might be
little more than was observable in other children of bright faculties;
except as Pearl, in the dearth of human playmates, was
thrown more upon the visionary throng which she created. The
singularity lay in the hostile feelings with which the child regarded
all these offspring of her own heart and mind. She never created
a friend, but seemed always to be sowing broadcast the dragon’s
teeth, whence sprung a harvest of armed enemies, against whom
she rushed to battle. It was inexpressibly sad—then what<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[112]" id="pgepubid00117"><a id="Page_112" title="[112]"></a></span>
depth of sorrow to a mother, who felt in her own heart the
cause!—to observe, in one so young, this constant recognition
of an adverse world, and so fierce a training of the energies that
were to make good her cause, in the contest that must ensue.</p>
<p>Gazing at Pearl, Hester Prynne often dropped her work upon
her knees, and cried out with an agony which she would fain
have hidden, but which made utterance for itself, betwixt speech
and a groan,—“O Father in Heaven,—if Thou art still my
Father,—what is this being which I have brought into the
world!” And Pearl, overhearing the ejaculation, or aware, through
some more subtile channel, of those throbs of anguish, would turn
her vivid and beautiful little face upon her mother, smile with
sprite-like intelligence, and resume her play.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[113]" id="pgepubid00118"><a id="Page_113" title="[113]"></a></span><a href="9125950922386535487_illu_113.jpg.id-6968194742523083545.wrap-0.html.xhtml" id="id-6968194742523083545" title="linked image"><img alt="A Touch of Pearl’s Baby Hand" src="9125950922386535487_illu_113_th.jpg" title="A Touch of Pearl’s Baby Hand" id="img_images_illu_113_th.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>One peculiarity of the child’s deportment remains yet to be
told. The very first thing which she had noticed in her life was—what?—not
the mother’s smile, responding to it, as other
babies do, by that faint, embryo smile of the little mouth, remembered
so doubtfully afterwards, and with such fond discussion
whether it were indeed a smile. By no means! But that first
object of which Pearl seemed to become aware was—shall we
say it?—the scarlet letter on Hester’s bosom! One day, as
her mother stooped over the cradle, the infant’s eyes had been
caught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the letter;
and, putting up her little hand, she grasped at it, smiling, not
doubtfully, but with a decided gleam, that gave her face the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[114]" id="pgepubid00119"><a id="Page_114" title="[114]"></a></span>
look of a much older child. Then, gasping for breath, did
Hester Prynne clutch the fatal token, instinctively endeavoring
to tear it away; so infinite was the torture inflicted by the intelligent
touch of Pearl’s baby-hand. Again, as if her mother’s agonized
gesture were meant only to make sport for her, did little<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[115]"><a id="Page_115" title="[115]"></a></span>
Pearl look into her eyes, and smile! From that epoch, except
when the child was asleep, Hester had never felt a moment’s
safety; not a moment’s calm enjoyment of her. Weeks, it is
true, would sometimes elapse, during which Pearl’s gaze might
never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter; but then, again, it
would come at unawares, like the stroke of sudden death, and
always with that peculiar smile, and odd expression of the eyes.</p>
<p>Once, this freakish, elvish cast came into the child’s eyes,
while Hester was looking at her own image in them, as mothers
are fond of doing; and, suddenly,—for women in solitude, and
with troubled hearts, are pestered with unaccountable delusions,—she
fancied that she beheld, not her own miniature portrait, but
another face, in the small black mirror of Pearl’s eye. It was
a face, fiend-like, full of smiling malice, yet bearing the semblance
of features that she had known full well, though seldom with a
smile, and never with malice in them. It was as if an evil spirit
possessed the child, and had just then peeped forth in mockery.
Many a time afterwards had Hester been tortured, though less
vividly, by the same illusion.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of a certain summer’s day, after Pearl grew
big enough to run about, she amused herself with gathering
handfuls of wild-flowers, and flinging them, one by one, at her
mother’s bosom; dancing up and down, like a little elf, whenever
she hit the scarlet letter. Hester’s first motion had been
to cover her bosom with her clasped hands. But, whether from
pride or resignation, or a feeling that her penance might best
be wrought out by this unutterable pain, she resisted the impulse,
and sat erect, pale as death, looking sadly into little Pearl’s
wild eyes. Still came the battery of flowers, almost invariably
hitting the mark, and covering the mother’s breast with hurts<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[116]" id="pgepubid00120"><a id="Page_116" title="[116]"></a></span>
for which she could find no balm in this world, nor knew how
to seek it in another. At last, her shot being all expended, the
child stood still and gazed at Hester, with that little, laughing
image of a fiend peeping out—or, whether it peeped or no,
her mother so imagined it—from the unsearchable abyss of her
black eyes.</p>
<p>“Child, what art thou?” cried the mother.</p>
<p>“O, I am your little Pearl!” answered the child.</p>
<p>But, while she said it, Pearl laughed, and began to dance
up and down, with the humorsome gesticulation of a little imp,
whose next freak might be to fly up the chimney.</p>
<p>“Art thou my child, in very truth?” asked Hester.</p>
<p>Nor did she put the question altogether idly, but, for the
moment, with a portion of genuine earnestness; for, such was
Pearl’s wonderful intelligence, that her mother half doubted
whether she were not acquainted with the secret spell of her
existence, and might not now reveal herself.</p>
<p>“Yes; I am little Pearl!” repeated the child, continuing
her antics.</p>
<p>“Thou art not my child! Thou art no Pearl of mine!”
said the mother, half playfully; for it was often the case that
a sportive impulse came over her, in the midst of her deepest
suffering. “Tell me, then, what thou art, and who sent thee
hither.”</p>
<p>“Tell me, mother!” said the child, seriously, coming up to
Hester, and pressing herself close to her knees. “Do thou tell
me!”</p>
<p>“Thy Heavenly Father sent thee!” answered Hester Prynne.</p>
<p>But she said it with a hesitation that did not escape the acuteness
of the child. Whether moved only by her ordinary freakishness,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[117]" id="pgepubid00121"><a id="Page_117" title="[117]"></a></span>
or because an evil spirit prompted her, she put up her
small forefinger, and touched the scarlet letter.</p>
<p>“He did not send me!” cried she, positively. “I have no
Heavenly Father!”</p>
<p>“Hush, Pearl, hush! Thou must not talk so!” answered
the mother, suppressing a groan. “He sent us all into this
world. He sent even me, thy mother. Then, much more, thee!
Or, if not, thou strange and elfish child, whence didst thou
come?”</p>
<p>“Tell me! Tell me!” repeated Pearl, no longer seriously,
but laughing, and capering about the floor. “It is thou that
must tell me!”</p>
<p>But Hester could not resolve the query, being herself in a dismal
labyrinth of doubt. She remembered—betwixt a smile and
a shudder—the talk of the neighboring towns-people; who, seeking
vainly elsewhere for the child’s paternity, and observing some
of her odd attributes, had given out that poor little Pearl was
a demon offspring; such as, ever since old Catholic times, had
occasionally been seen on earth, through the agency of their
mother’s sin, and to promote some foul and wicked purpose.
Luther, according to the scandal of his monkish enemies, was
a brat of that hellish breed; nor was Pearl the only child to
whom this inauspicious origin was assigned, among the New
England Puritans.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">Hester Prynne</span>
went, one day, to the
mansion of Governor
Bellingham, with a
pair of gloves, which
she had fringed and
embroidered to his order,
and which were
to be worn on some
great occasion of
state; for, though the
chances of a popular
election had caused
this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest
rank, he still held an honorable and influential place among the
colonial magistracy.</p>
<p>Another and far more important reason than the delivery of
a pair of embroidered gloves impelled Hester, at this time, to
seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[119]" id="pgepubid00125"><a id="Page_119" title="[119]"></a></span>
in the affairs of the settlement. It had reached her ears, that
there was a design on the part of some of the leading inhabitants,
cherishing the more rigid order of principles in religion and
government, to deprive her of her child. On the supposition
that Pearl, as already hinted, was of demon origin, these good
people not unreasonably argued that a Christian interest in the
mother’s soul required them to remove such a stumbling-block
from her path. If the child, on the other hand, were really
capable of moral and religious growth, and possessed the elements
of ultimate salvation, then, surely, it would enjoy all the
fairer prospect of these advantages, by being transferred to wiser
and better guardianship than Hester Prynne’s. Among those
who promoted the design, Governor Bellingham was said to be
one of the most busy. It may appear singular, and indeed, not
a little ludicrous, that an affair of this kind, which, in later
days, would have been referred to no higher jurisdiction than
that of the selectmen of the town, should then have been a question
publicly discussed, and on which statesmen of eminence took
sides. At that epoch of pristine simplicity, however, matters
of even slighter public interest, and of far less intrinsic weight,
than the welfare of Hester and her child, were strangely mixed
up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state. The
period was hardly, if at all, earlier than that of our story, when
a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only
caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the
colony, but resulted in an important modification of the framework
itself of the legislature.</p>
<p>Full of concern, therefore,—but so conscious of her own right
that it seemed scarcely an unequal match between the public,
on the one side, and a lonely woman, backed by the sympathies<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[120]" id="pgepubid00126"><a id="Page_120" title="[120]"></a></span>
of nature, on the other,—Hester Prynne set forth from her solitary
cottage. Little Pearl, of course, was her companion. She
was now of an age to run lightly along by her mother’s side,
and, constantly in motion, from morn till sunset, could have
accomplished a much longer journey than that before her. Often,
nevertheless, more from caprice than necessity, she demanded to
be taken up in arms; but was soon as imperious to be set down
again, and frisked onward before Hester on the grassy pathway,
with many a harmless trip and tumble. We have spoken of
Pearl’s rich and luxuriant beauty; a beauty that shone with deep
and vivid tints; a bright complexion, eyes possessing intensity
both of depth and glow, and hair already of a deep, glossy brown,
and which, in after years, would be nearly akin to black. There
was fire in her and throughout her; she seemed the unpremeditated
offshoot of a passionate moment. Her mother, in contriving
the child’s garb, had allowed the gorgeous tendencies of her
imagination their full play; arraying her in a crimson velvet
tunic, of a peculiar cut, abundantly embroidered with fantasies
and flourishes of gold-thread. So much strength of coloring,
which must have given a wan and pallid aspect to cheeks of a
fainter bloom, was admirably adapted to Pearl’s beauty, and made
her the very brightest little jet of flame that ever danced upon
the earth.</p>
<p>But it was a remarkable attribute of this garb, and, indeed,
of the child’s whole appearance, that it irresistibly and inevitably
reminded the beholder of the token which Hester Prynne
was doomed to wear upon her bosom. It was the scarlet letter
in another form; the scarlet letter endowed with life! The
mother herself—as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched
into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form—had<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[121]" id="pgepubid00127"><a id="Page_121" title="[121]"></a></span>
carefully wrought out the similitude; lavishing many hours of
morbid ingenuity, to create an analogy between the object of her
affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture. But, in
truth, Pearl was the one, as well as the other; and only in consequence
of that identity had Hester contrived so perfectly to
represent the scarlet letter in her appearance.</p>
<p>As the two wayfarers came within the precincts of the town,
the children of the Puritans looked up from their play,—or
what passed for play with those sombre little urchins,—and
spake gravely one to another:—</p>
<p>“Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlet letter; and,
of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlet letter
running along by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling
mud at them!”</p>
<p>But Pearl, who was a dauntless child, after frowning, stamping
her foot, and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening
gestures, suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies,
and put them all to flight. She resembled, in her fierce pursuit
of them, an infant pestilence,—the scarlet fever, or some such
half-fledged angel of judgment,—whose mission was to punish
the sins of the rising generation. She screamed and shouted,
too, with a terrific volume of sound, which, doubtless, caused
the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them. The victory
accomplished, Pearl returned quietly to her mother, and looked
up, smiling, into her face.</p>
<p>Without further adventure, they reached the dwelling of Governor
Bellingham. This was a large wooden house, built in a
fashion of which there are specimens still extant in the streets
of our older towns; now moss-grown, crumbling to decay, and
melancholy at heart with the many sorrowful or joyful occurrences,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[122]" id="pgepubid00128"><a id="Page_122" title="[122]"></a></span>
remembered or forgotten, that have happened, and passed
away, within their dusky chambers. Then, however, there was
the freshness of the passing year on its exterior, and the cheerfulness,
gleaming forth from the sunny windows, of a human
habitation, into which death had never entered. It had, indeed,
a very cheery aspect; the walls being overspread with a kind
of stucco, in which fragments of broken glass were plentifully
intermixed; so that, when the sunshine fell aslant-wise over the
front of the edifice, it glittered and sparkled as if diamonds
had been flung against it by the double handful. The brilliancy
might have befitted Aladdin’s palace, rather than the mansion
of a grave old Puritan ruler. It was further decorated with
strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams, suitable
to the quaint taste of the age, which had been drawn in the
stucco when newly laid on, and had now grown hard and durable,
for the admiration of after times.</p>
<p>Pearl, looking at this bright wonder of a house, began to caper
and dance, and imperatively required that the whole breadth
of sunshine should be stripped off its front, and given her to
play with.</p>
<p>“No, my little Pearl!” said her mother. “Thou must gather
thine own sunshine. I have none to give thee!”</p>
<p>They approached the door; which was of an arched form,
and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of
the edifice, in both of which were lattice-windows, with wooden
shutters to close over them at need. Lifting the iron hammer
that hung at the portal, Hester Prynne gave a summons, which
was answered by one of the Governor’s bond-servants; a free-born
Englishman, but now a seven years’ slave. During that
term he was to be the property of his master, and as much a<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[123]" id="pgepubid00129"><a id="Page_123" title="[123]"></a></span>
commodity of bargain and sale as an ox, or a joint-stool. The
serf wore the blue coat, which was the customary garb of serving-men
of that period, and long before, in the old hereditary halls
of England.</p>
<p>“Is the worshipful Governor Bellingham within?” inquired
Hester.</p>
<p>“Yea, forsooth,” replied the bond-servant, staring with wide-open
eyes at the scarlet letter, which, being a new-comer in
the country, he had never before seen. “Yea, his honorable
worship is within. But he hath a godly minister or two with
him, and likewise a leech. Ye may not see his worship now.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, I will enter,” answered Hester Prynne, and
the bond-servant, perhaps judging from the decision of her air,
and the glittering symbol in her bosom, that she was a great
lady in the land, offered no opposition.</p>
<p>So the mother and little Pearl were admitted into the hall of
entrance. With many variations, suggested by the nature of his
building-materials, diversity of climate, and a different mode of
social life, Governor Bellingham had planned his new habitation
after the residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native land.
Here, then, was a wide and reasonably lofty hall, extending
through the whole depth of the house, and forming a medium
of general communication, more or less directly, with all the
other apartments. At one extremity, this spacious room was
lighted by the windows of the two towers, which formed a small
recess on either side of the portal. At the other end, though
partly muffled by a curtain, it was more powerfully illuminated
by one of those embowed hall-windows which we read of in old
books, and which was provided with a deep and cushioned seat.
Here, on the cushion, lay a folio tome, probably of the Chronicles<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[124]" id="pgepubid00130"><a id="Page_124" title="[124]"></a></span>
of England, or other such substantial literature; even as, in our
own days, we scatter gilded volumes on the centre-table, to be
turned over by the casual guest. The furniture of the hall consisted
of some ponderous chairs, the backs of which were elaborately
carved with wreaths of oaken flowers; and likewise a table
in the same taste; the whole being of the Elizabethan age, or
perhaps earlier, and heirlooms, transferred hither from the Governor’s
paternal home. On the table—in token that the sentiment
of old English hospitality had not been left behind—stood
a large pewter tankard, at the bottom of which, had Hester or
Pearl peeped into it, they might have seen the frothy remnant
of a recent draught of ale.</p>
<p>On the wall hung a row of portraits, representing the forefathers
of the Bellingham lineage, some with armor on their
breasts, and others with stately ruffs and robes of peace. All
were characterized by the sternness and severity which old portraits
so invariably put on; as if they were the ghosts, rather
than the pictures, of departed worthies, and were gazing with
harsh and intolerant criticism at the pursuits and enjoyments of
living men.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[125]" id="pgepubid00131"><a id="Page_125" title="[125]"></a></span><a href="9125950922386535487_illu_125.jpg.id-2840773361415736035.wrap-0.html.xhtml" id="id-2840773361415736035" title="linked image"><img alt="The Governor’s Breastplate" src="9125950922386535487_illu_125_th.jpg" title="The Governor’s Breastplate" id="img_images_illu_125_th.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>At about the centre of the oaken panels, that lined the hall,
was suspended a suit of mail, not, like the pictures, an ancestral
relic, but of the most modern date; for it had been manufactured
by a skilful armorer in London, the same year in which
Governor Bellingham came over to New England. There was a<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[126]" id="pgepubid00132"><a id="Page_126" title="[126]"></a></span>
steel head-piece, a cuirass, a gorget, and greaves, with a pair of
gauntlets and a sword hanging beneath; all, and especially the
helmet and breastplate, so highly burnished as to glow with
white radiance, and scatter an illumination everywhere about
upon the floor. This bright panoply was not meant for mere<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[127]"><a id="Page_127" title="[127]"></a></span>
idle show, but had been worn by the Governor on many a solemn
muster and training field, and had glittered, moreover, at the
head of a regiment in the Pequod war. For, though bred a
lawyer, and accustomed to speak of Bacon, Coke, Noye, and
Finch as his professional associates, the exigencies of this new
country had transformed Governor Bellingham into a soldier, as
well as a statesman and ruler.</p>
<p>Little Pearl—who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming
armor as she had been with the glittering frontispiece of the
house—spent some time looking into the polished mirror of
the breastplate.</p>
<p>“Mother,” cried she, “I see you here. Look! Look!”</p>
<p>Hester looked, by way of humoring the child; and she saw
that, owing to the peculiar effect of this convex mirror, the
scarlet letter was represented in exaggerated and gigantic proportions,
so as to be greatly the most prominent feature of her
appearance. In truth, she seemed absolutely hidden behind it.
Pearl pointed upward, also, at a similar picture in the head-piece;
smiling at her mother, with the elfish intelligence that
was so familiar an expression on her small physiognomy. That
look of naughty merriment was likewise reflected in the mirror,
with so much breadth and intensity of effect, that it made Hester
Prynne feel as if it could not be the image of her own child,
but of an imp who was seeking to mould itself into Pearl’s
shape.</p>
<p>“Come along, Pearl,” said she, drawing her away. “Come
and look into this fair garden. It may be we shall see flowers
there; more beautiful ones than we find in the woods.”</p>
<p>Pearl, accordingly, ran to the bow-window, at the farther end
of the hall, and looked along the vista of a garden-walk, carpeted<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[128]" id="pgepubid00133"><a id="Page_128" title="[128]"></a></span>
with closely shaven grass, and bordered with some rude and
immature attempt at shrubbery. But the proprietor appeared
already to have relinquished, as hopeless, the effort to perpetuate
on this side of the Atlantic, in a hard soil and amid the close
struggle for subsistence, the native English taste for ornamental
gardening. Cabbages grew in plain sight; and a pumpkin-vine,
rooted at some distance, had run across the intervening space,
and deposited one of its gigantic products directly beneath the
hall-window; as if to warn the Governor that this great lump
of vegetable gold was as rich an ornament as New England earth
would offer him. There were a few rose-bushes, however, and a
number of apple-trees, probably the descendants of those planted
by the Reverend Mr. Blackstone, the first settler of the peninsula;
that half-mythological personage, who rides through our
early annals, seated on the back of a bull.</p>
<p>Pearl, seeing the rose-bushes, began to cry for a red rose,
and would not be pacified.</p>
<p>“Hush, child, hush!” said her mother, earnestly. “Do not
cry, dear little Pearl! I hear voices in the garden. The Governor
is coming, and gentlemen along with him!”</p>
<p>In fact, adown the vista of the garden avenue a number of
persons were seen approaching towards the house. Pearl, in utter
scorn of her mother’s attempt to quiet her, gave an eldritch
scream, and then became silent; not from any notion of obedience,
but because the quick and mobile curiosity of her disposition
was excited by the appearance of these new personages.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">overnor Bellingham</span>, in a loose gown
and easy cap,—such as elderly gentlemen
loved to endue themselves with, in their
domestic privacy,—walked foremost, and appeared
to be showing off his estate, and
expatiating on his projected improvements.
The wide circumference of an elaborate ruff, beneath his gray
beard, in the antiquated fashion of King James’s reign, caused
his head to look not a little like that of John the Baptist in
a charger. The impression made by his aspect, so rigid and
severe, and frost-bitten with more than autumnal age, was hardly
in keeping with the appliances of worldly enjoyment wherewith
he had evidently done his utmost to surround himself. But it
is an error to suppose that our grave forefathers—though accustomed
to speak and think of human existence as a state merely
of trial and warfare, and though unfeignedly prepared to sacrifice
goods and life at the behest of duty—made it a matter
of conscience to reject such means of comfort, or even luxury,
as lay fairly within their grasp. This creed was never taught,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[130]"><a id="Page_130" title="[130]"></a></span>
for instance, by the venerable pastor, John Wilson, whose beard,
white as a snow-drift, was seen over Governor Bellingham’s
shoulder; while its wearer suggested that pears and peaches
might yet be naturalized in the New England climate, and that
purple grapes might possibly be compelled to nourish, against
the sunny garden-wall. The old clergyman, nurtured at the
rich bosom of the English Church, had a long-established and
legitimate taste for all good and comfortable things; and however
stern he might show himself in the pulpit, or in his public reproof
of such transgressions as that of Hester Prynne, still the genial
benevolence of his private life had won him warmer affection
than was accorded to any of his professional contemporaries.</p>
<p>Behind the Governor and Mr. Wilson came two other guests:
one the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, whom the reader may
remember as having taken a brief and reluctant part in the
scene of Hester Prynne’s disgrace; and, in close companionship
with him, old Roger Chillingworth, a person of great skill
in physic, who, for two or three years past, had been settled
in the town. It was understood that this learned man was the
physician as well as friend of the young minister, whose health
had severely suffered, of late, by his too unreserved self-sacrifice
to the labors and duties of the pastoral relation.</p>
<p>The Governor, in advance of his visitors, ascended one or two
steps, and, throwing open the leaves of the great hall-window,
found himself close to little Pearl. The shadow of the curtain
fell on Hester Prynne, and partially concealed her.</p>
<p>“What have we here?” said Governor Bellingham, looking
with surprise at the scarlet little figure before him. “I profess,
I have never seen the like, since my days of vanity, in old
King James’s time, when I was wont to esteem it a high favor<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[131]" id="pgepubid00137"><a id="Page_131" title="[131]"></a></span>
to be admitted to a court mask! There used to be a swarm
of these small apparitions, in holiday time; and we called them
children of the Lord of Misrule. But how gat such a guest
into my hall?”</p>
<p>“Ay, indeed!” cried good old Mr. Wilson. “What little
bird of scarlet plumage may this be? Methinks I have seen
just such figures, when the sun has been shining through a richly
painted window, and tracing out the golden and crimson images
across the floor. But that was in the old land. Prithee, young
one, who art thou, and what has ailed thy mother to bedizen
thee in this strange fashion? Art thou a Christian child,—ha?
Dost know thy catechism? Or art thou one of those
naughty elfs or fairies, whom we thought to have left behind
us, with other relics of Papistry, in merry old England?”</p>
<p>“I am mother’s child,” answered the scarlet vision, “and
my name is Pearl!”</p>
<p>“Pearl?—Ruby, rather!—or Coral!—or Red Rose, at the
very least, judging from thy hue!” responded the old minister,
putting forth his hand in a vain attempt to pat little Pearl on
the cheek. “But where is this mother of thine? Ah! I see,”
he added; and, turning to Governor Bellingham, whispered,
“This is the selfsame child of whom we have held speech together;
and behold here the unhappy woman, Hester Prynne,
her mother!”</p>
<p>“Sayest thou so?” cried the Governor. “Nay, we might
have judged that such a child’s mother must needs be a scarlet
woman, and a worthy type of her of Babylon! But she comes
at a good time; and we will look into this matter forthwith.”</p>
<p>Governor Bellingham stepped through the window into the
hall, followed by his three guests.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[132]" id="pgepubid00138"><a id="Page_132" title="[132]"></a></span></p>
<p>“Hester Prynne,” said he, fixing his naturally stern regard
on the wearer of the scarlet letter, “there hath been much question
concerning thee, of late. The point hath been weightily
discussed, whether we, that are of authority and influence, do
well discharge our consciences by trusting an immortal soul,
such as there is in yonder child, to the guidance of one who
hath stumbled and fallen, amid the pitfalls of this world. Speak
thou, the child’s own mother! Were it not, thinkest thou, for
thy little one’s temporal and eternal welfare that she be taken
out of thy charge, and clad soberly, and disciplined strictly,
and instructed in the truths of heaven and earth? What canst
thou do for the child, in this kind?”</p>
<p>“I can teach my little Pearl what I have learned from this!”
answered Hester Prynne, laying her finger on the red token.</p>
<p>“Woman, it is thy badge of shame!” replied the stern magistrate.
“It is because of the stain which that letter indicates,
that we would transfer thy child to other hands.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless,” said the mother, calmly, though growing more
pale, “this badge hath taught me—it daily teaches me—it is
teaching me at this moment—lessons whereof my child may
be the wiser and better, albeit they can profit nothing to myself.”</p>
<p>“We will judge warily,” said Bellingham, “and look well
what we are about to do. Good Master Wilson, I pray you,
examine this Pearl,—since that is her name,—and see whether
she hath had such Christian nurture as befits a child of her age.”</p>
<p>The old minister seated himself in an arm-chair, and made
an effort to draw Pearl betwixt his knees. But the child, unaccustomed
to the touch or familiarity of any but her mother,
escaped through the open window, and stood on the upper step,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[133]" id="pgepubid00139"><a id="Page_133" title="[133]"></a></span>
looking like a wild tropical bird, of rich plumage, ready to take
flight into the upper air. Mr. Wilson, not a little astonished
at this outbreak,—for he was a grandfatherly sort of personage,
and usually a vast favorite with children,—essayed, however,
to proceed with the examination.</p>
<p>“Pearl,” said he, with great solemnity, “thou must take heed
to instruction, that so, in due season, thou mayest wear in thy
bosom the pearl of great price. Canst thou tell me, my child,
who made thee?”</p>
<p>Now Pearl knew well enough who made her; for Hester
Prynne, the daughter of a pious home, very soon after her talk
with the child about her Heavenly Father, had begun to inform
her of those truths which the human spirit, at whatever stage of
immaturity, imbibes with such eager interest. Pearl, therefore,
so large were the attainments of her three years’ lifetime, could
have borne a fair examination in the New England Primer, or
the first column of the Westminster Catechisms, although unacquainted
with the outward form of either of those celebrated
works. But that perversity which all children have more or less
of, and of which little Pearl had a tenfold portion, now, at the
most inopportune moment, took thorough possession of her, and
closed her lips, or impelled her to speak words amiss. After
putting her finger in her mouth, with many ungracious refusals
to answer good Mr. Wilson’s question, the child finally announced
that she had not been made at all, but had been plucked by her
mother off the bush of wild roses that grew by the prison-door.</p>
<p>This fantasy was probably suggested by the near proximity
of the Governor’s red roses, as Pearl stood outside of the window;
together with her recollection of the prison rose-bush, which she
had passed in coming hither.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[134]" id="pgepubid00140"><a id="Page_134" title="[134]"></a></span></p>
<p>Old Roger Chillingworth, with a smile on his face, whispered
something in the young clergyman’s ear. Hester Prynne looked
at the man of skill, and even then, with her fate hanging in the
balance, was startled to perceive what a change had come over
his features,—how much uglier they were,—how his dark complexion
seemed to have grown duskier, and his figure more misshapen,—since
the days when she had familiarly known him.
She met his eyes for an instant, but was immediately constrained
to give all her attention to the scene now going forward.</p>
<p>“This is awful!” cried the Governor, slowly recovering from
the astonishment into which Pearl’s response had thrown him.
“Here is a child of three years old, and she cannot tell who
made her! Without question, she is equally in the dark as to
her soul, its present depravity, and future destiny! Methinks,
gentlemen, we need inquire no further.”</p>
<p>Hester caught hold of Pearl, and drew her forcibly into her
arms, confronting the old Puritan magistrate with almost a fierce
expression. Alone in the world, cast off by it, and with this
sole treasure to keep her heart alive, she felt that she possessed
indefeasible rights against the world, and was ready to defend
them to the death.</p>
<p>“God gave me the child!” cried she. “He gave her in
requital of all things else, which ye had taken from me. She is
my happiness!—she is my torture, none the less! Pearl keeps
me here in life! Pearl punishes me too! See ye not, she is
the scarlet letter, only capable of being loved, and so endowed
with a million-fold the power of retribution for my sin? Ye
shall not take her! I will die first!”</p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[135]" id="pgepubid00141"><a id="Page_135" title="[135]"></a></span><a href="9125950922386535487_illu_135.jpg.id-8209913275552321104.wrap-0.html.xhtml" id="id-8209913275552321104" title="linked image"><img alt="Look thou to it!

<p>“My poor woman,” said the not unkind old minister, “the
child shall be well cared for!—far better than thou canst do it!”<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[136]" id="pgepubid00142"><a id="Page_136" title="[136]"></a></span></p>
<p>“God gave her into my keeping,” repeated Hester Prynne,
raising her voice almost to a shriek. “I will not give her
up!”—And here, by a sudden impulse, she turned to the young<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[137]" id="pgepubid00143"><a id="Page_137" title="[137]"></a></span>
clergyman, Mr. Dimmesdale, at whom, up to this moment, she
had seemed hardly so much as once to direct her eyes.—“Speak
thou for me!” cried she. “Thou wast my pastor, and hadst
charge of my soul, and knowest me better than these men can.
I will not lose the child! Speak for me! Thou knowest,—for
thou hast sympathies which these men lack!—thou knowest
what is in my heart, and what are a mother’s rights, and how
much the stronger they are, when that mother has but her child
and the scarlet letter! Look thou to it! I will not lose the
child! Look to it!”</p>
<p>At this wild and singular appeal, which indicated that Hester
Prynne’s situation had provoked her to little less than madness,
the young minister at once came forward, pale, and holding his
hand over his heart, as was his custom whenever his peculiarly
nervous temperament was thrown into agitation. He looked now
more care-worn and emaciated than as we described him at the
scene of Hester’s public ignominy; and whether it were his
failing health, or whatever the cause might be, his large dark
eyes had a world of pain in their troubled and melancholy
depth.</p>
<p>“There is truth in what she says,” began the minister, with
a voice sweet, tremulous, but powerful, insomuch that the hall
re-echoed, and the hollow armor rang with it,—“truth in what
Hester says, and in the feeling which inspires her! God gave
her the child, and gave her, too, an instinctive knowledge of its
nature and requirements,—both seemingly so peculiar,—which
no other mortal being can possess. And, moreover, is there not<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[138]" id="pgepubid00144"><a id="Page_138" title="[138]"></a></span>
a quality of awful sacredness in the relation between this mother
and this child?”</p>
<p>“Ay!—how is that, good Master Dimmesdale?” interrupted
the Governor. “Make that plain, I pray you!”</p>
<p>“It must be even so,” resumed the minister. “For, if we
deem it otherwise, do we not thereby say that the Heavenly
Father, the Creator of all flesh, hath lightly recognized a deed of
sin, and made of no account the distinction between unhallowed
lust and holy love? This child of its father’s guilt and its
mother’s shame hath come from the hand of God, to work in
many ways upon her heart, who pleads so earnestly, and with
such bitterness of spirit, the right to keep her. It was meant
for a blessing; for the one blessing of her life! It was meant,
doubtless, as the mother herself hath told us, for a retribution
too; a torture to be felt at many an unthought-of moment; a
pang, a sting, an ever-recurring agony, in the midst of a troubled
joy! Hath she not expressed this thought in the garb of the
poor child, so forcibly reminding us of that red symbol which
sears her bosom?”</p>
<p>“Well said, again!” cried good Mr. Wilson. “I feared the
woman had no better thought than to make a mountebank of
her child!”</p>
<p>“O, not so!—not so!” continued Mr. Dimmesdale. “She
recognizes, believe me, the solemn miracle which God hath
wrought, in the existence of that child. And may she feel,
too,—what, methinks, is the very truth,—that this boon was
meant, above all things else, to keep the mother’s soul alive,
and to preserve her from blacker depths of sin into which Satan
might else have sought to plunge her! Therefore it is good for
this poor, sinful woman that she hath an infant immortality, a<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[139]" id="pgepubid00145"><a id="Page_139" title="[139]"></a></span>
being capable of eternal joy or sorrow, confided to her care,—to
be trained up by her to righteousness,—to remind her, at
every moment, of her fall,—but yet to teach her, as it were
by the Creator’s sacred pledge, that, if she bring the child to
heaven, the child also will bring its parent thither! Herein is
the sinful mother happier than the sinful father. For Hester
Prynne’s sake, then, and no less for the poor child’s sake, let
us leave them as Providence hath seen fit to place them!”</p>
<p>“You speak, my friend, with a strange earnestness,” said old
Roger Chillingworth, smiling at him.</p>
<p>“And there is a weighty import in what my young brother
hath spoken,” added the Reverend Mr. Wilson. “What say
you, worshipful Master Bellingham? Hath he not pleaded well
for the poor woman?”</p>
<p>“Indeed hath he,” answered the magistrate, “and hath adduced
such arguments, that we will even leave the matter as it now
stands; so long, at least, as there shall be no further scandal
in the woman. Care must be had, nevertheless, to put the child
to due and stated examination in the catechism, at thy hands
or Master Dimmesdale’s. Moreover, at a proper season, the
tithing-men must take heed that she go both to school and to
meeting.”</p>
<p>The young minister, on ceasing to speak, had withdrawn a
few steps from the group, and stood with his face partially concealed
in the heavy folds of the window-curtain; while the shadow
of his figure, which the sunlight cast upon the floor, was tremulous
with the vehemence of his appeal. Pearl, that wild and
flighty little elf, stole softly towards him, and taking his hand in
the grasp of both her own, laid her cheek against it; a caress so
tender, and withal so unobtrusive, that her mother, who was looking<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[140]" id="pgepubid00146"><a id="Page_140" title="[140]"></a></span>
on, asked herself,—“Is that my Pearl?” Yet she knew that
there was love in the child’s heart, although it mostly revealed
itself in passion, and hardly twice in her lifetime had been softened
by such gentleness as now. The minister,—for, save the long-sought
regards of woman, nothing is sweeter than these marks
of childish preference, accorded spontaneously by a spiritual
instinct, and therefore seeming to imply in us something truly
worthy to be loved,—the minister looked round, laid his hand
on the child’s head, hesitated an instant, and then kissed her
brow. Little Pearl’s unwonted mood of sentiment lasted no
longer; she laughed, and went capering down the hall, so airily,
that old Mr. Wilson raised a question whether even her tiptoes
touched the floor.</p>
<p>“The little baggage hath witchcraft in her, I profess,” said
he to Mr. Dimmesdale. “She needs no old woman’s broomstick
to fly withal!”</p>
<p>“A strange child!” remarked old Roger Chillingworth. “It
is easy to see the mother’s part in her. Would it be beyond
a philosopher’s research, think ye, gentlemen, to analyze that
child’s nature, and, from its make and mould, to give a shrewd
guess at the father?”</p>
<p>“Nay; it would be sinful, in such a question, to follow the
clew of profane philosophy,” said Mr. Wilson. “Better to fast
and pray upon it; and still better, it may be, to leave the mystery
as we find it, unless Providence reveal it of its own accord.
Thereby, every good Christian man hath a title to show a father’s
kindness towards the poor, deserted babe.”</p>
<p>The affair being so satisfactorily concluded, Hester Prynne,
with Pearl, departed from the house. As they descended the
steps, it is averred that the lattice of a chamber-window was<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[141]" id="pgepubid00147"><a id="Page_141" title="[141]"></a></span>
thrown open, and forth into the sunny day was thrust the face
of Mistress Hibbins, Governor Bellingham’s bitter-tempered sister,
and the same who, a few years later, was executed as a
witch.</p>
<p>“Hist, hist!” said she, while her ill-omened physiognomy
seemed to cast a shadow over the cheerful newness of the house.
“Wilt thou go with us to-night? There will be a merry company
in the forest; and I wellnigh promised the Black Man
that comely Hester Prynne should make one.”</p>
<p>“Make my excuse to him, so please you!” answered Hester,
with a triumphant smile. “I must tarry at home, and keep
watch over my little Pearl. Had they taken her from me, I
would willingly have gone with thee into the forest, and signed
my name in the Black Man’s book too, and that with mine own
blood!”</p>
<p>“We shall have thee there anon!” said the witch-lady, frowning,
as she drew back her head.</p>
<p>But here—if we suppose this interview betwixt Mistress Hibbins
and Hester Prynne to be authentic, and not a parable—was
already an illustration of the young minister’s argument
against sundering the relation of a fallen mother to the offspring
of her frailty. Even thus early had the child saved her from
Satan’s snare.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">nder</span> the appellation of Roger Chillingworth,
the reader will remember, was hidden another
name, which its former wearer had resolved
should never more be spoken. It has been
related, how, in the crowd that witnessed
Hester Prynne’s ignominious exposure, stood
a man, elderly, travel-worn, who, just emerging from the perilous
wilderness, beheld the woman, in whom he hoped to find embodied
the warmth and cheerfulness of home, set up as a type of sin
before the people. Her matronly fame was trodden under all
men’s feet. Infamy was babbling around her in the public
market-place. For her kindred, should the tidings ever reach
them, and for the companions of her unspotted life, there remained
nothing but the contagion of her dishonor; which would not
fail to be distributed in strict accordance and proportion with
the intimacy and sacredness of their previous relationship. Then
why—since the choice was with himself—should the individual,
whose connection with the fallen woman had been the most
intimate and sacred of them all, come forward to vindicate his<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[143]"><a id="Page_143" title="[143]"></a></span>
claim to an inheritance so little desirable? He resolved not to
be pilloried beside her on her pedestal of shame. Unknown to
all but Hester Prynne, and possessing the lock and key of her
silence, he chose to withdraw his name from the roll of mankind,
and, as regarded his former ties and interests, to vanish out of
life as completely as if he indeed lay at the bottom of the ocean,
whither rumor had long ago consigned him. This purpose once
effected, new interests would immediately spring up, and likewise
a new purpose; dark, it is true, if not guilty, but of force
enough to engage the full strength of his faculties.</p>
<p>In pursuance of this resolve, he took up his residence in the
Puritan town, as Roger Chillingworth, without other introduction
than the learning and intelligence of which he possessed more
than a common measure. As his studies, at a previous period
of his life, had made him extensively acquainted with the medical
science of the day, it was as a physician that he presented himself,
and as such was cordially received. Skilful men, of the
medical and chirurgical profession, were of rare occurrence in the
colony. They seldom, it would appear, partook of the religious
zeal that brought other emigrants across the Atlantic. In their
researches into the human frame, it may be that the higher and
more subtile faculties of such men were materialized, and that
they lost the spiritual view of existence amid the intricacies of
that wondrous mechanism, which seemed to involve art enough
to comprise all of life within itself. At all events, the health of
the good town of Boston, so far as medicine had aught to do
with it, had hitherto lain in the guardianship of an aged deacon
and apothecary, whose piety and godly deportment were stronger
testimonials in his favor than any that he could have produced
in the shape of a diploma. The only surgeon was one who<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[144]" id="pgepubid00151"><a id="Page_144" title="[144]"></a></span>
combined the occasional exercise of that noble art with the daily
and habitual flourish of a razor. To such a professional body
Roger Chillingworth was a brilliant acquisition. He soon manifested
his familiarity with the ponderous and imposing machinery
of antique physic; in which every remedy contained a multitude
of far-fetched and heterogeneous ingredients, as elaborately compounded
as if the proposed result had been the Elixir of Life.
In his Indian captivity, moreover, he had gained much knowledge
of the properties of native herbs and roots; nor did he
conceal from his patients, that these simple medicines, Nature’s
boon to the untutored savage, had quite as large a share of his
own confidence as the European pharmacopœia, which so many
learned doctors had spent centuries in elaborating.</p>
<p>This learned stranger was exemplary, as regarded, at least,
the outward forms of a religious life, and, early after his arrival,
had chosen for his spiritual guide the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale.
The young divine, whose scholar-like renown still lived in Oxford,
was considered by his more fervent admirers as little less than
a heaven-ordained apostle, destined, should he live and labor for
the ordinary term of life, to do as great deeds for the now
feeble New England Church, as the early Fathers had achieved
for the infancy of the Christian faith. About this period, however,
the health of Mr. Dimmesdale had evidently begun to fail.
By those best acquainted with his habits, the paleness of the
young minister’s cheek was accounted for by his too earnest devotion
to study, his scrupulous fulfilment of parochial duty, and,
more than all, by the fasts and vigils of which he made a frequent
practice, in order to keep the grossness of this earthly
state from clogging and obscuring his spiritual lamp. Some
declared, that, if Mr. Dimmesdale were really going to die, it<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[145]" id="pgepubid00152"><a id="Page_145" title="[145]"></a></span>
was cause enough, that the world was not worthy to be any
longer trodden by his feet. He himself, on the other hand,
with characteristic humility, avowed his belief, that, if Providence
should see fit to remove him, it would be because of his
own unworthiness to perform its humblest mission here on earth.
With all this difference of opinion as to the cause of his decline,
there could be no question of the fact. His form grew emaciated;
his voice, though still rich and sweet, had a certain melancholy
prophecy of decay in it; he was often observed, on any slight
alarm or other sudden accident, to put his hand over his heart,
with first a flush and then a paleness, indicative of pain.</p>
<p>Such was the young clergyman’s condition, and so imminent
the prospect that his dawning light would be extinguished, all
untimely, when Roger Chillingworth made his advent to the town.
His first entry on the scene, few people could tell whence, dropping
down, as it were, out of the sky, or starting from the nether
earth, had an aspect of mystery, which was easily heightened to
the miraculous. He was now known to be a man of skill; it
was observed that he gathered herbs, and the blossoms of wild-flowers,
and dug up roots, and plucked off twigs from the forest-trees,
like one acquainted with hidden virtues in what was
valueless to common eyes. He was heard to speak of Sir
Kenelm Digby, and other famous men,—whose scientific attainments
were esteemed hardly less than supernatural,—as having
been his correspondents or associates. Why, with such rank in
the learned world, had he come hither? What could he, whose
sphere was in great cities, be seeking in the wilderness? In
answer to this query, a rumor gained ground,—and, however
absurd, was entertained by some very sensible people,—that
Heaven had wrought an absolute miracle, by transporting an<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[146]" id="pgepubid00153"><a id="Page_146" title="[146]"></a></span>
eminent Doctor of Physic, from a German university, bodily
through the air, and setting him down at the door of Mr. Dimmesdale’s
study! Individuals of wiser faith, indeed, who knew that
Heaven promotes its purposes without aiming at the stage-effect
of what is called miraculous interposition, were inclined to
see a providential hand in Roger Chillingworth’s so opportune
arrival.</p>
<p>This idea was countenanced by the strong interest which the
physician ever manifested in the young clergyman; he attached
himself to him as a parishioner, and sought to win a friendly
regard and confidence from his naturally reserved sensibility. He
expressed great alarm at his pastor’s state of health, but was
anxious to attempt the cure, and, if early undertaken, seemed
not despondent of a favorable result. The elders, the deacons,
the motherly dames, and the young and fair maidens, of Mr.
Dimmesdale’s flock, were alike importunate that he should make
trial of the physician’s frankly offered skill. Mr. Dimmesdale
gently repelled their entreaties.</p>
<p>“I need no medicine,” said he.</p>
<p>But how could the young minister say so, when, with every
successive Sabbath, his cheek was paler and thinner, and his
voice more tremulous than before,—when it had now become a
constant habit, rather than a casual gesture, to press his hand
over his heart? Was he weary of his labors? Did he wish to
die? These questions were solemnly propounded to Mr. Dimmesdale
by the elder ministers of Boston and the deacons of his
church, who, to use their own phrase, “dealt with him” on the
sin of rejecting the aid which Providence so manifestly held out.
He listened in silence, and finally promised to confer with the
physician.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[147]" id="pgepubid00154"><a id="Page_147" title="[147]"></a></span></p>
<p>“Were it God’s will,” said the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale,
when, in fulfilment of this pledge, he requested old Roger Chillingworth’s
professional advice, “I could be well content, that
my labors, and my sorrows, and my sins, and my pains, should
shortly end with me, and what is earthly of them be buried in
my grave, and the spiritual go with me to my eternal state,
rather than that you should put your skill to the proof in my
behalf.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” replied Roger Chillingworth, with that quietness which,
whether imposed or natural, marked all his deportment, “it is
thus that a young clergyman is apt to speak. Youthful men,
not having taken a deep root, give up their hold of life so easily!
And saintly men, who walk with God on earth, would fain be
away, to walk with him on the golden pavements of the New
Jerusalem.”</p>
<p>“Nay,” rejoined the young minister, putting his hand to his
heart, with a flush of pain flitting over his brow, “were I worthier
to walk there, I could be better content to toil here.”</p>
<p>“Good men ever interpret themselves too meanly,” said the
physician.</p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[148]" id="pgepubid00155"><a id="Page_148" title="[148]"></a></span><a href="9125950922386535487_illu_148.jpg.id-2719540988780292772.wrap-0.html.xhtml" id="id-2719540988780292772" title="linked image"><img alt="The Minister and Leech" src="9125950922386535487_illu_148_th.jpg" title="The Minister and Leech" id="img_images_illu_148_th.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In this manner, the mysterious old Roger Chillingworth became
the medical adviser of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. As not
only the disease interested the physician, but he was strongly moved
to look into the character and qualities of the patient, these two
men, so different in age, came gradually to spend much time
together. For the sake of the minister’s health, and to enable
the leech to gather plants with healing balm in them, they took
long walks on the sea-shore, or in the forest; mingling various
talk with the plash and murmur of the waves, and the solemn
wind-anthem among the tree-tops. Often, likewise, one was the
guest of the other, in his place of study and retirement. There
was a fascination for the minister in the company of the man
of science, in whom he recognized an intellectual cultivation
of no moderate depth or scope; together with a range and freedom
of ideas, that he would have vainly looked for among the
members of his own profession. In truth, he was startled, if not
shocked, to find this attribute in the physician. Mr. Dimmesdale
was a true priest, a true religionist, with the reverential sentiment
largely developed, and an order of mind that impelled itself
powerfully along the track of a creed, and wore its passage continually
deeper with the lapse of time. In no state of society
would he have been what is called a man of liberal views; it
would always be essential to his peace to feel the pressure of a
faith about him, supporting, while it confined him within its iron<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[149]" id="pgepubid00156"><a id="Page_149" title="[149]"></a></span>
framework. Not the less, however, though with a tremulous
enjoyment, did he feel the occasional relief of looking at the
universe through the medium of another kind of intellect than
those with which he habitually held converse. It was as if a
window were thrown open, admitting a freer atmosphere into
the close and stifled study, where his life was wasting itself away,
amid lamplight, or obstructed day-beams, and the musty fragrance,
be it sensual or moral, that exhales from books. But the air
was too fresh and chill to be long breathed with comfort. So
the minister, and the physician with him, withdrew again within
the limits of what their church defined as orthodox.</p>
<p>Thus Roger Chillingworth scrutinized his patient carefully, both
as he saw him in his ordinary life, keeping an accustomed pathway
in the range of thoughts familiar to him, and as he appeared
when thrown amidst other moral scenery, the novelty of which
might call out something new to the surface of his character.
He deemed it essential, it would seem, to know the man, before
attempting to do him good. Wherever there is a heart and an
intellect, the diseases of the physical frame are tinged with the
peculiarities of these. In Arthur Dimmesdale, thought and
imagination were so active, and sensibility so intense, that the
bodily infirmity would be likely to have its groundwork there.
So Roger Chillingworth—the man of skill, the kind and friendly
physician—strove to go deep into his patient’s bosom, delving
among his principles, prying into his recollections, and probing
everything with a cautious touch, like a treasure-seeker in a
dark cavern. Few secrets can escape an investigator, who has
opportunity and license to undertake such a quest, and skill to
follow it up. A man burdened with a secret should especially
avoid the intimacy of his physician. If the latter possess native<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[150]" id="pgepubid00157"><a id="Page_150" title="[150]"></a></span>
sagacity, and a nameless something more,—let us call it intuition;
if he show no intrusive egotism, nor disagreeably prominent
characteristics of his own; if he have the power, which must
be born with him, to bring his mind into such affinity with his
patient’s, that this last shall unawares have spoken what he
imagines himself only to have thought; if such revelations
be received without tumult, and acknowledged not so often by
an uttered sympathy as by silence, an inarticulate breath, and
here and there a word, to indicate that all is understood; if to
these qualifications of a confidant be joined the advantages afforded
by his recognized character as a physician;—then, at some inevitable
moment, will the soul of the sufferer be dissolved, and flow
forth in a dark, but transparent stream, bringing all its mysteries
into the daylight.</p>
<p>Roger Chillingworth possessed all, or most, of the attributes
above enumerated. Nevertheless, time went on; a kind of intimacy,
as we have said, grew up between these two cultivated
minds, which had as wide a field as the whole sphere of human
thought and study, to meet upon; they discussed every topic
of ethics and religion, of public affairs and private character;
they talked much, on both sides, of matters that seemed personal
to themselves; and yet no secret, such as the physician fancied
must exist there, ever stole out of the minister’s consciousness
into his companion’s ear. The latter had his suspicions, indeed,
that even the nature of Mr. Dimmesdale’s bodily disease had
never fairly been revealed to him. It was a strange reserve!</p>
<p>After a time, at a hint from Roger Chillingworth, the friends
of Mr. Dimmesdale effected an arrangement by which the two
were lodged in the same house; so that every ebb and flow of
the minister’s life-tide might pass under the eye of his anxious<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[151]" id="pgepubid00158"><a id="Page_151" title="[151]"></a></span>
and attached physician. There was much joy throughout the
town, when this greatly desirable object was attained. It was
held to be the best possible measure for the young clergyman’s
welfare; unless, indeed, as often urged by such as felt authorized
to do so, he had selected some one of the many blooming damsels,
spiritually devoted to him, to become his devoted wife.
This latter step, however, there was no present prospect that
Arthur Dimmesdale would be prevailed upon to take; he rejected
all suggestions of the kind, as if priestly celibacy were one of his
articles of church-discipline. Doomed by his own choice, therefore,
as Mr. Dimmesdale so evidently was, to eat his unsavory
morsel always at another’s board, and endure the life-long chill
which must be his lot who seeks to warm himself only at another’s
fireside, it truly seemed that this sagacious, experienced, benevolent
old physician, with his concord of paternal and reverential
love for the young pastor, was the very man, of all mankind,
to be constantly within reach of his voice.</p>
<p>The new abode of the two friends was with a pious widow,
of good social rank, who dwelt in a house covering pretty nearly
the site on which the venerable structure of King’s Chapel has
since been built. It had the graveyard, originally Isaac Johnson’s
home-field, on one side, and so was well adapted to call
up serious reflections, suited to their respective employments, in
both minister and man of physic. The motherly care of the
good widow assigned to Mr. Dimmesdale a front apartment, with
a sunny exposure, and heavy window-curtains, to create a noontide
shadow, when desirable. The walls were hung round with
tapestry, said to be from the Gobelin looms, and, at all events,
representing the Scriptural story of David and Bathsheba, and
Nathan the Prophet, in colors still unfaded, but which made the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[152]" id="pgepubid00159"><a id="Page_152" title="[152]"></a></span>
fair woman of the scene almost as grimly picturesque as the woe-denouncing
seer. Here the pale clergyman piled up his library,
rich with parchment-bound folios of the Fathers, and the lore
of Rabbis, and monkish erudition, of which the Protestant divines,
even while they vilified and decried that class of writers, were yet
constrained often to avail themselves. On the other side of the
house old Roger Chillingworth arranged his study and laboratory;
not such as a modern man of science would reckon even
tolerably complete, but provided with a distilling apparatus, and
the means of compounding drugs and chemicals, which the practised
alchemist knew well how to turn to purpose. With such
commodiousness of situation, these two learned persons sat themselves
down, each in his own domain, yet familiarly passing from
one apartment to the other, and bestowing a mutual and not
incurious inspection into one another’s business.</p>
<p>And the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale’s best discerning friends,
as we have intimated, very reasonably imagined that the hand
of Providence had done all this, for the purpose—besought in
so many public, and domestic, and secret prayers—of restoring
the young minister to health. But—it must now be said—another
portion of the community had latterly begun to take its
own view of the relation betwixt Mr. Dimmesdale and the mysterious
old physician. When an uninstructed multitude attempts
to see with its eyes, it is exceedingly apt to be deceived. When,
however, it forms its judgment, as it usually does, on the intuitions
of its great and warm heart, the conclusions thus attained
are often so profound and so unerring, as to possess the character
of truths supernaturally revealed. The people, in the case
of which we speak, could justify its prejudice against Roger Chillingworth
by no fact or argument worthy of serious refutation.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[153]" id="pgepubid00160"><a id="Page_153" title="[153]"></a></span>
There was an aged handicraftsman, it is true, who had been a
citizen of London at the period of Sir Thomas Overbury’s murder,
now some thirty years agone; he testified to having seen
the physician, under some other name, which the narrator of
the story had now forgotten, in company with Doctor Forman, the
famous old conjurer, who was implicated in the affair of Overbury.
Two or three individuals hinted, that the man of skill,
during his Indian captivity, had enlarged his medical attainments
by joining in the incantations of the savage priests; who were
universally acknowledged to be powerful enchanters, often performing
seemingly miraculous cures by their skill in the black
art. A large number—and many of these were persons of such
sober sense and practical observation that their opinions would
have been valuable, in other matters—affirmed that Roger Chillingworth’s
aspect had undergone a remarkable change while he
had dwelt in town, and especially since his abode with Mr.
Dimmesdale. At first, his expression had been calm, meditative,
scholar-like. Now, there was something ugly and evil in his
face, which they had not previously noticed, and which grew
still the more obvious to sight, the oftener they looked upon
him. According to the vulgar idea, the fire in his laboratory
had been brought from the lower regions, and was fed with
infernal fuel; and so, as might be expected, his visage was getting
sooty with the smoke.</p>
<p>To sum up the matter, it grew to be a widely diffused opinion,
that the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, like many other personages
of especial sanctity, in all ages of the Christian world, was
haunted either by Satan himself, or Satan’s emissary, in the
guise of old Roger Chillingworth. This diabolical agent had the
Divine permission, for a season, to burrow into the clergyman’s<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[154]" id="pgepubid00161"><a id="Page_154" title="[154]"></a></span>
intimacy, and plot against his soul. No sensible man, it was
confessed, could doubt on which side the victory would turn.
The people looked, with an unshaken hope, to see the minister
come forth out of the conflict, transfigured with the glory which
he would unquestionably win. Meanwhile, nevertheless, it was
sad to think of the perchance mortal agony through which he
must struggle towards his triumph.</p>
<p>Alas! to judge from the gloom and terror in the depths of
the poor minister’s eyes, the battle was a sore one and the victory
anything but secure.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstwords">ld</span> Roger Chillingworth, throughout life, had
been calm in temperament, kindly, though
not of warm affections, but ever, and in all
his relations with the world, a pure and
upright man. He had begun an investigation,
as he imagined, with the severe and
equal integrity of a judge, desirous only of truth, even as if the
question involved no more than the air-drawn lines and figures
of a geometrical problem, instead of human passions, and wrongs
inflicted on himself. But, as he proceeded, a terrible fascination,
a kind of fierce, though still calm, necessity, seized the old man
within its gripe, and never set him free again, until he had done
all its bidding. He now dug into the poor clergyman’s heart,
like a miner searching for gold; or, rather, like a sexton delving
into a grave, possibly in quest of a jewel that had been buried
on the dead man’s bosom, but likely to find nothing save mortality
and corruption. Alas for his own soul, if these were
what he sought!<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[156]"><a id="Page_156" title="[156]"></a></span></p>
<p>Sometimes, a light glimmered out of the physician’s eyes,
burning blue and ominous, like the reflection of a furnace, or,
let us say, like one of those gleams of ghastly fire that darted
from Bunyan’s awful doorway in the hillside, and quivered on
the pilgrim’s face. The soil where this dark miner was working
had perchance shown indications that encouraged him.</p>
<p>“This man,” said he, at one such moment, to himself, “pure
as they deem him,—all spiritual as he seems,—hath inherited
a strong animal nature from his father or his mother. Let us
dig a little further in the direction of this vein!”</p>
<p>Then, after long search into the minister’s dim interior, and
turning over many precious materials, in the shape of high aspirations
for the welfare of his race, warm love of souls, pure sentiments,
natural piety, strengthened by thought and study, and
illuminated by revelation,—all of which invaluable gold was
perhaps no better than rubbish to the seeker,—he would turn
back, discouraged, and begin his quest towards another point.
He groped along as stealthily, with as cautious a tread, and as
wary an outlook, as a thief entering a chamber where a man
lies only half asleep,—or, it may be, broad awake,—with purpose
to steal the very treasure which this man guards as the apple
of his eye. In spite of his premeditated carefulness, the floor
would now and then creak; his garments would rustle; the
shadow of his presence, in a forbidden proximity, would be thrown
across his victim. In other words, Mr. Dimmesdale, whose sensibility
of nerve often produced the effect of spiritual intuition,
would become vaguely aware that something inimical to his
peace had thrust itself into relation with him. But old Roger
Chillingworth, too, had perceptions that were almost intuitive;
and when the minister threw his startled eyes towards him, there<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[157]" id="pgepubid00165"><a id="Page_157" title="[157]"></a></span>
the physician sat; his kind, watchful, sympathizing, but never
intrusive friend.</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Dimmesdale would perhaps have seen this individual’s
character more perfectly, if a certain morbidness, to which, sick
hearts are liable, had not rendered him suspicious of all mankind.
Trusting no man as his friend, he could not recognize
his enemy when the latter actually appeared. He therefore still
kept up a familiar intercourse with him, daily receiving the old
physician in his study; or visiting the laboratory, and, for recreation’s
sake, watching the processes by which weeds were converted
into drugs of potency.</p>
<p>One day, leaning his forehead on his hand, and his elbow on
the sill of the open window, that looked towards the graveyard,
he talked with Roger Chillingworth, while the old man was
examining a bundle of unsightly plants.</p>
<p>“Where,” asked he, with a look askance at them,—for it
was the clergyman’s peculiarity that he seldom, nowadays, looked
straightforth at any object, whether human or inanimate,—“where,
my kind doctor, did you gather those herbs, with such
a dark, flabby leaf?”</p>
<p>“Even in the graveyard here at hand,” answered the physician,
continuing his employment. “They are new to me. I
found them growing on a grave, which bore no tombstone, nor
other memorial of the dead man, save these ugly weeds, that
have taken upon themselves to keep him in remembrance. They
grew out of his heart, and typify, it may be, some hideous secret
that was buried with him, and which he had done better to
confess during his lifetime.”</p>
<p>“Perchance,” said Mr. Dimmesdale, “he earnestly desired it,
but could not.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[158]" id="pgepubid00166"><a id="Page_158" title="[158]"></a></span>”</p>
<p>“And wherefore?” rejoined the physician. “Wherefore not;
since all the powers of nature call so earnestly for the confession
of sin, that these black weeds have sprung up out of a
buried heart, to make manifest an unspoken crime?”</p>
<p>“That, good Sir, is but a fantasy of yours,” replied the minister.
“There can be, if I forebode aright, no power, short of
the Divine mercy, to disclose, whether by uttered words, or by
type or emblem, the secrets that may be buried with a human
heart. The heart, making itself guilty of such secrets, must
perforce hold them, until the day when all hidden things shall
be revealed. Nor have I so read or interpreted Holy Writ, as
to understand that the disclosure of human thoughts and deeds,
then to be made, is intended as a part of the retribution. That,
surely, were a shallow view of it. No; these revelations, unless
I greatly err, are meant merely to promote the intellectual satisfaction
of all intelligent beings, who will stand waiting, on that
day, to see the dark problem of this life made plain. A knowledge
of men’s hearts will be needful to the completest solution
of that problem. And I conceive, moreover, that the hearts
holding such miserable secrets as you speak of will yield them
up, at that last day, not with reluctance, but with a joy unutterable.”</p>
<p>“Then why not reveal them here?” asked Roger Chillingworth,
glancing quietly aside at the minister. “Why should
not the guilty ones sooner avail themselves of this unutterable
solace?”</p>
<p>“They mostly do,” said the clergyman, griping hard at his
breast as if afflicted with an importunate throb of pain. “Many,
many a poor soul hath given its confidence to me, not only on
the death-bed, but while strong in life, and fair in reputation.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[159]" id="pgepubid00167"><a id="Page_159" title="[159]"></a></span>
And ever, after such an outpouring, O, what a relief have I
witnessed in those sinful brethren! even as in one who at last
draws free air, after long stifling with his own polluted breath.
How can it be otherwise? Why should a wretched man, guilty,
we will say, of murder, prefer to keep the dead corpse buried
in his own heart, rather than fling it forth at once, and let the
universe take care of it!”</p>
<p>“Yet some men bury their secrets thus,” observed the calm
physician.</p>
<p>“True; there are such men,” answered Mr. Dimmesdale.
“But, not to suggest more obvious reasons, it may be that they
are kept silent by the very constitution of their nature. Or,—can
we not suppose it?—guilty as they may be, retaining,
nevertheless, a zeal for God’s glory and man’s welfare, they
shrink from displaying themselves black and filthy in the view
of men; because, thenceforward, no good can be achieved by
them; no evil of the past be redeemed by better service. So, to
their own unutterable torment, they go about among their fellow-creatures,
looking pure as new-fallen snow while their hearts
are all speckled and spotted with iniquity of which they cannot
rid themselves.”</p>
<p>“These men deceive themselves,” said Roger Chillingworth,
with somewhat more emphasis than usual, and making a slight
gesture with his forefinger. “They fear to take up the shame
that rightfully belongs to them. Their love for man, their zeal
for God’s service,—these holy impulses may or may not coexist
in their hearts with the evil inmates to which their guilt has
unbarred the door, and which must needs propagate a hellish
breed within them. But, if they seek to glorify God, let them
not lift heavenward their unclean hands! If they would serve<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[160]" id="pgepubid00168"><a id="Page_160" title="[160]"></a></span>
their fellow-men, let them do it by making manifest the power
and reality of conscience, in constraining them to penitential
self-abasement! Wouldst thou have me to believe, O wise and
pious friend, that a false show can be better—can be more
for God’s glory, or man’s welfare—than God’s own truth?
Trust me, such men deceive themselves!”</p>
<p>“It may be so,” said the young clergyman, indifferently, as
waiving a discussion that he considered irrelevant or unseasonable.
He had a ready faculty, indeed, of escaping from any
topic that agitated his too sensitive and nervous temperament.—“But,
now, I would ask of my well-skilled physician, whether,
in good sooth, he deems me to have profited by his kindly care
of this weak frame of mine?”</p>
<p>Before Roger Chillingworth could answer, they heard the clear,
wild laughter of a young child’s voice, proceeding from the adjacent
burial-ground. Looking instinctively from the open window,—for
it was summer-time,—the minister beheld Hester
Prynne and little Pearl passing along the footpath that traversed
the enclosure. Pearl looked as beautiful as the day, but was
in one of those moods of perverse merriment which, whenever
they occurred, seemed to remove her entirely out of the sphere
of sympathy or human contact. She now skipped irreverently
from one grave to another; until, coming to the broad, flat,
armorial tombstone of a departed worthy,—perhaps of Isaac
Johnson himself,—she began to dance upon it. In reply to
her mother’s command and entreaty that she would behave more
decorously, little Pearl paused to gather the prickly burrs from
a tall burdock which grew beside the tomb. Taking a handful
of these, she arranged them along the lines of the scarlet letter
that decorated the maternal bosom, to which the burrs, as<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[161]" id="pgepubid00169"><a id="Page_161" title="[161]"></a></span>
their nature was, tenaciously adhered. Hester did not pluck
them off.</p>
<p>Roger Chillingworth had by this time approached the window,
and smiled grimly down.</p>
<p>“There is no law, nor reverence for authority, no regard for
human ordinances or opinions, right or wrong, mixed up with
that child’s composition,” remarked he, as much to himself as
to his companion. “I saw her, the other day, bespatter the
Governor himself with water, at the cattle-trough in Spring
Lane. What, in Heaven’s name, is she? Is the imp altogether
evil? Hath she affections? Hath she any discoverable
principle of being?”</p>
<p>“None, save the freedom of a broken law,” answered Mr.
Dimmesdale, in a quiet way, as if he had been discussing the
point within himself. “Whether capable of good, I know
not.”</p>
<p>The child probably overheard their voices; for, looking up
to the window, with a bright, but naughty smile of mirth and
intelligence, she threw one of the prickly burrs at the Reverend
Mr. Dimmesdale. The sensitive clergyman shrunk, with nervous
dread, from the light missile. Detecting his emotion, Pearl
clapped her little hands, in the most extravagant ecstasy. Hester
Prynne, likewise, had involuntarily looked up; and all these four
persons, old and young, regarded one another in silence, till
the child laughed aloud, and shouted,—“Come away, mother!
Come away, or yonder old Black Man will catch you! He hath
got hold of the minister already. Come away, mother, or he
will catch you! But he cannot catch little Pearl!”</p>
<p>So she drew her mother away, skipping, dancing, and frisking
fantastically, among the hillocks of the dead people, like a creature<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[162]" id="pgepubid00170"><a id="Page_162" title="[162]"></a></span>
that had nothing in common with a bygone and buried
generation, nor owned herself akin to it. It was as if she had
been made afresh, out of new elements, and must perforce be
permitted to live her own life, and be a law unto herself, without
her eccentricities being reckoned to her for a crime.</p>
<p>“There goes a woman,” resumed Roger Chillingworth, after
a pause, “who, be her demerits what they may, hath none of
that mystery of hidden sinfulness which you deem so grievous
to be borne. Is Hester Prynne the less miserable, think you,
for that scarlet letter on her breast?”</p>
<p>“I do verily believe it,” answered the clergyman. “Nevertheless,
I cannot answer for her. There was a look of pain in
her face, which I would gladly have been spared the sight of.
But still, methinks, it must needs be better for the sufferer to
be free to show his pain, as this poor woman Hester is, than
to cover it all up in his heart.”</p>
<p>There was another pause; and the physician began anew to
examine and arrange the plants which he had gathered.</p>
<p>“You inquired of me, a little time agone,” said he, at length,
“my judgment as touching your health.”</p>
<p>“I did,” answered the clergyman, “and would gladly learn
it. Speak frankly, I pray you, be it for life or death.”</p>
<p>“Freely, then, and plainly,” said the physician, still busy
with his plants, but keeping a wary eye on Mr. Dimmesdale,
“the disorder is a strange one; not so much in itself, nor as
outwardly manifested,—in so far, at least, as the symptoms
have been laid open to my observation. Looking daily at you,
my good Sir, and watching the tokens of your aspect, now for
months gone by, I should deem you a man sore sick, it may be,
yet not so sick but that an instructed and watchful physician<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[163]" id="pgepubid00171"><a id="Page_163" title="[163]"></a></span>
might well hope to cure you. But—I know not what to say—the
disease is what I seem to know, yet know it not.”</p>
<p>“You speak in riddles, learned Sir,” said the pale minister,
glancing aside out of the window.</p>
<p>“Then, to speak more plainly,” continued the physician, “and
I crave pardon, Sir,—should it seem to require pardon,—for
this needful plainness of my speech. Let me ask,—as your
friend,—as one having charge, under Providence, of your life
and physical well-being,—hath all the operation of this disorder
been fairly laid open and recounted to me?”</p>
<p>“How can you question it?” asked the minister. “Surely,
it were child’s play, to call in a physician, and then hide the
sore!”</p>
<p>“You would tell me, then, that I know all?” said Roger Chillingworth,
deliberately, and fixing an eye, bright with intense
and concentrated intelligence, on the minister’s face. “Be it so!
But, again! He to whom only the outward and physical evil
is laid open, knoweth, oftentimes, but half the evil which he is
called upon to cure. A bodily disease, which we look upon as
whole and entire within itself, may, after all, be but a symptom
of some ailment in the spiritual part. Your pardon, once again,
good Sir, if my speech give the shadow of offence. You, Sir,
of all men whom I have known, are he whose body is the closest
conjoined, and imbued, and identified, so to speak, with the spirit
whereof it is the instrument.”</p>
<p>“Then I need ask no further,” said the clergyman, somewhat
hastily rising from his chair. “You deal not, I take it, in medicine
for the soul!”</p>
<p>“Thus, a sickness,” continued Roger Chillingworth, going on,
in an unaltered tone, without heeding the interruption,—but<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[164]" id="pgepubid00172"><a id="Page_164" title="[164]"></a></span>
standing up, and confronting the emaciated and white-cheeked
minister, with his low, dark, and misshapen figure,—“a sickness,
a sore place, if we may so call it, in your spirit, hath immediately
its appropriate manifestation in your bodily frame. Would
you, therefore, that your physician heal the bodily evil? How
may this be, unless you first lay open to him the wound or trouble
in your soul?”</p>
<p>“No!—not to thee!—not to an earthly physician!” cried
Mr. Dimmesdale, passionately, and turning his eyes, full and
bright, and with a kind of fierceness, on old Roger Chillingworth.
“Not to thee! But if it be the soul’s disease, then
do I commit myself to the one Physician of the soul! He,
if it stand with his good pleasure, can cure; or he can kill!
Let him do with me as, in his justice and wisdom, he
shall see good. But who art thou, that meddlest in this matter?—that
dares thrust himself between the sufferer and his
God?”</p>
<p>With a frantic gesture he rushed out of the room.</p>
<p>“It is as well to have made this step,” said Roger Chillingworth
to himself, looking after the minister with a grave smile.
“There is nothing lost. We shall be friends again anon. But
see, now, how passion takes hold upon this man, and hurrieth
him out of himself! As with one passion, so with another!
He hath done a wild thing erenow, this pious Master Dimmesdale,
in the hot passion of his heart!”</p>
<p class="figcenter"><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[165]" id="pgepubid00173"><a id="Page_165" title="[165]"></a></span><a href="9125950922386535487_illu_165.jpg.id-4068973608514409642.wrap-0.html.xhtml" id="id-4068973608514409642" title="linked image"><img alt="The Leech and his Patient" src="9125950922386535487_illu_165_th.jpg" title="The Leech and his Patient" id="img_images_illu_165_th.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It proved not difficult to re-establish the intimacy of the two
companions, on the same footing and in the same degree as
heretofore. The young clergyman, after a few hours of privacy,
was sensible that the disorder of his nerves had hurried him
into an unseemly outbreak of temper, which there had been
nothing in the physician’s words to excuse or palliate. He
marvelled, indeed, at the violence with which he had thrust
back the kind old man, when merely proffering the advice
which it was his duty to bestow, and which the minister himself
had expressly sought. With these remorseful feelings, he
lost no time in making the amplest apologies, and besought his
friend still to continue the care, which, if not successful in
restoring him to health, had, in all probability, been the means
of prolonging his feeble existence to that hour. Roger Chillingworth
readily assented, and went on with his medical supervision
of the minister; doing his best for him, in all good
faith, but always quitting the patient’s apartment, at the close
of a professional interview, with a mysterious and puzzled smile
upon his lips. This expression was invisible in Mr. Dimmesdale’s<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[166]" id="pgepubid00174"><a id="Page_166" title="[166]"></a></span>
presence, but grew strongly evident as the physician
crossed the threshold.</p>
<p>“A rare case!” he muttered. “I must needs look deeper
into it. A strange sympathy betwixt soul and body! Were
it only for the art’s sake, I must search this matter to the
bottom!”</p>
<p>It came to pass, not long after the scene above recorded,
that the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, at noonday, and entirely
unawares, fell into a deep, deep slumber, sitting in his chair,
with a large black-letter volume open before him on the table.
It must have been a work of vast ability in the somniferous
school of literature. The profound depth of the minister’s
repose was the more remarkable, inasmuch as he was one of
those persons whose sleep, ordinarily, is as light, as fitful, and
as easily scared away, as a small bird hopping on a twig. To
such an unwonted remoteness, however, had his spirit now withdrawn
into itself, that he stirred not in his chair, when old
Roger Chillingworth, without any extraordinary precaution, came
into the room. The physician advanced directly in front of
his patient, laid his hand upon his bosom, and thrust aside
the vestment, that, hitherto, had always covered it even from
the professional eye.</p>
<p>Then, indeed, Mr. Dimmesdale shuddered, and slightly stirred.</p>
<p>After a brief pause, the physician turned away.</p>
<p>But, with what a wild look of wonder, joy, and horror! With
what a ghastly rapture, as it were, too mighty to be expressed
only by the eye and features, and therefore bursting forth through
the whole ugliness of his figure, and making itself even riotously
manifest by the extravagant gestures with which he threw up his
arms towards the ceiling, and stamped his foot upon the floor!<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[167]" id="pgepubid00175"><a id="Page_167" title="[167]"></a></span>
Had a man seen old Roger Chillingworth, at that moment of his
ecstasy, he would have had no need to ask how Satan comports
himself, when a precious human soul is lost to heaven, and won
into his kingdom.</p>
<p>But what distinguished the physician’s ecstasy from Satan’s
was the trait of wonder in it!</p>
